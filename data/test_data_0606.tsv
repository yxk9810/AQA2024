{"query": "Draw an Apollonian GasketGiven three mutually tangent circles, we can always find two more circles which are tangent to all three of those. These two are called Apollonian circles. Note that one of the Apollonian circles might actually be around the three initial circles.Starting from three tangent circles, we can create a fractal called an Apollonian gasket, by the following process:Call the initial 3 circles the parent circlesFind the parent circles' two Apollonian circlesFor each Apollonian circle:For each pair of the three pairs of parent circles:Call the Apollonian circle and the two parent circles the new set of parent circles and start over from step 2.E.g. starting with circles of equal size, we get:Image found on WikipediaThere's one more bit of notation we need. If we have a circle of radius r with centre (x, y), we can define it's curvature as k = Usually k will be positive, but we can use negative k to denote the circle that encloses all the other circles in the gasket (i.e. all tangents touch that circle from the inside). Then we can specify a circle with a triplet of numbers: (k, x*k, y*k).For the purpose of this question, we will assume positive integer k and rational x and y.Further examples for such circles can be found in the Wikipedia article.There's also some interesting stuff about integral gaskets in this article (among other fun things with circles).The ChallengeYou will be given 4 circle specifications, each of which will look like (14, You can use any list format and division operator that is convenient, such that you can simply eval the input if you wish to. You may assume that the 4 circles are indeed tangent to each other, and that the first of them has negative curvature. That means you are already given the surrounding Apollonian circle of the other three. For a list of valid example inputs, see the bottom of the challenge.Write a program or function which, given this input, draws an Apollonian gasket.You may take input via function argument, ARGV or STDIN and either render the fractal on screen or write it to an image file in a format of your choice.If the resulting image is rasterised, it must be at least 400 pixels on each side, with less than 20% padding around the largest circle. You may stop recursing when you reach circles whose radius is less than a 400th of the largest input circle, or circles which are smaller than a pixel, whichever happens first.You must draw only circle outlines, not full discs, but the colours of background and lines are your choice. The outlines must not be wider than a 200th of the outer circles diameter.This is code golf, so the shortest answer (in bytes) wins.Example InputsHere are all integral gaskets from the Wikipedia article converted to the prescribed input format:[[-1, 0, 0], [2, 1, 0], [2, -1, 0], [3, 0, 2]][[-2, 0, 0], [3, 0], [6, -2, 0], [7, 2]][[-3, 0, 0], [4, 0], [12, -3, 0], [13, 2]][[-3, 0, 0], [5, 0], [8, -1], [8, 1]][[-4, 0, 0], [5, 0], [20, -4, 0], [21, 2]][[-4, 0, 0], [8, 1, 0], [9, -1], [9, 1]][[-5, 0, 0], [6, 0], [30, -5, 0], [31, 2]][[-5, 0, 0], [7, 0], [18, -1], [18, 1]][[-6, 0, 0], [7, 0], [42, -6, 0], [43, 2]][[-6, 0, 0], [10, 0], [15, 0], [19, 2]][[-6, 0, 0], [11, 0], [14, [15, 0, 0], [8, 0], [56, -7, 0], [57, 2]][[-7, 0, 0], [9, 0], [32, -1], [32, 1]][[-7, 0, 0], [12, 0], [17, [20, 0, 0], [9, 0], [72, -8, 0], [73, 2]][[-8, 0, 0], [12, 0], [25, -1], [25, 1]][[-8, 0, 0], [13, 0], [21, [24, 0, 0], [10, 0], [90, -9, 0], [91, 2]][[-9, 0, 0], [11, 0], [50, -1], [50, 1]][[-9, 0, 0], [14, 0], [26, [27, 0, 0], [18, 1, 0], [19, [22, 0, 0], [11, 0], [110, -10, 0], [111, 2]][[-10, 0, 0], [14, 0], [35, 0], [39, 2]][[-10, 0, 0], [18, 0], [23, [27, 0, 0], [12, 0], [132, -11, 0], [133, 2]][[-11, 0, 0], [13, 0], [72, -1], [72, 1]][[-11, 0, 0], [16, 0], [36, [37, 0, 0], [21, 0], [24, [28, 0, 0], [13, 0], [156, -12, 0], [157, 2]][[-12, 0, 0], [16, 0], [49, -1], [49, 1]][[-12, 0, 0], [17, 0], [41, [44, 0, 0], [21, 0], [28, 0], [37, 2]][[-12, 0, 0], [21, 0], [29, [32, -1, 0, 0], [25, 0], [25, [28, 0, 0], [14, 0], [182, -13, 0], [183, 2]][[-13, 0, 0], [15, 0], [98, -1], [98, 1]][[-13, 0, 0], [18, 0], [47, [50, 0, 0], [23, 0], [30, [38, 0, 0], [15, 0], [210, -14, 0], [211, 2]][[-14, 0, 0], [18, 0], [63, 0], [67, 2]][[-14, 0, 0], [19, 0], [54, [55, 0, 0], [22, 0], [39, [43, 0, 0], [27, 0], [31, [34, 0, 0], [16, 0], [240, -15, 0], [241, 2]][[-15, 0, 0], [17, 0], [128, -1], [128, 1]][[-15, 0, 0], [24, 0], [40, 0], [49, 2]][[-15, 0, 0], [24, 0], [41, [44, 0, 0], [28, 0], [33, [40, 0, 0], [32, 0], [32, [33,", "query_id": 15}

{"query": "pointwise vs. continuous observations in PDE inverse problemI work on an inverse problem for my Ph.D. research, which for simplicity's sake we'll say is determining $\\beta$ in$L(\\beta)u \\equiv -\\nabla\\cdot(k_0e^\\beta\\nabla u) = f$from some observations $u^o$; $k_0$ is a constant and $f$ is known. This is typically formulated as an optimization problem for extremizing$J[u, \\lambda; \\beta] = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_\\Omega(u(x) - u^o(x))^2dx + \\int_\\Omega\\lambda(L(\\beta)u - f)dx$where $\\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier. The functional derivative of $J$ with respect to $\\beta$ can be computed by solving the adjoint equation$L(\\beta)\\lambda = u - u^o.$Some regularizing functional $R[\\beta]$ is added to the problem for the usual reasons.The unspoken assumption here is that the observed data $u^o$ are defined continuously throughout the domain $\\Omega$. I think it might be more appropriate for my problem to instead use$J[u, \\lambda; \\beta] = \\sum_{n = 1}^N\\frac{(u(x_n) - u^o(x_n))^2}{2\\sigma_n^2} + \\int_\\Omega\\lambda(L(\\beta)u - f)dx$where $x_n$ are the points at which the measurements are taken and $\\sigma_n$ is the standard deviation of the $n$-th measurement. The measurements of this field are often spotty and missing chunks; why interpolate to get a continuous field of dubious fidelity if that can be avoided?This gives me pause because the adjoint equation becomes$L(\\beta)\\lambda = \\sum_{n = 1}^N\\frac{u(x_n) - u^o(x_n)}{\\sigma_n^2}\\delta(x - x_n)$where $\\delta$ is the Dirac delta function. I'm solving this using finite elements, so in principle integrating a shape function against a delta function amounts to evaluating the shape function at that point. Still, the regularity issues probably shouldn't be dismissed out of hand. My best guess is that the objective functional should be defined in terms of the finite element approximation to all the fields, rather than in terms of the real fields and then discretized after.I can't find any comparisons of assuming continuous or pointwise measurements in inverse problems in the literature, either in relation to the specific problem I'm working on or generally. Often pointwise measurements are used without any mention of the incipient regularity issues, e.g. here. Is there any published work comparing the assumptions of continuous vs. pointwise measurements? Should I be concerned about the delta functions in the pointwise case?", "query_id": 17}
{"query": "The smallest area of a convex grid polygonI got an email from Hugo Pfoertner, an Editor-in-Chief at the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, with a terrific idea for a fastest-code challenge, which will also help verify or expand the boundary of an open mathematical question in optimization.Here's the idea: we want to confirm and extend OEIS sequences A063984 and A070911, which are about finding convex polygons on the grid \\$\\mathbb Z \\times \\mathbb Z\\$ that have \\$n\\$ vertices and minimal area. (See an example below.) These sequences had been computed up to \\$n=25\\$, but unfortunately, some of the programs that were used to compute these sequences have been lost, and it would be useful to have new programs that we could use to confirm the sequence.If you are able to extend the sequence or correct any erroneous terms, Hugo or I will update the OEIS to give you credit for that—plus, you'll get lots of brownie points from me. :)ChallengeYour program should take a positive integer n (\\$n \\geq 3\\$) and output a set of \\$n\\$ vertices of an area-minimal convex \\$n\\$-gon with vertices in the square grid. It should also output twice1 the area of the corresponding polygon, which should be equal to (or less than!) \\$A070911(n)\\$.This is a fastest-code challenge, and the score will be based on the largest \\$n\\$ that you can compute on my machine2 in under \\$10\\$ minutes. In case of a tie, whichever program computes the next value fastest will win.It would be helpful for me if you would post the runtimes and results from running your program on your machine, so that I can get an order-of-magnitude estimate for how quickly your program runs.ExamplesThe OEIS sequence A070911 begins (starting at the index \\$n=3\\$): $$1, 2, 5, 6, 13, 14, 21, 28, 43, 48, 65, 80, 103, 118, 151, 174, 213, 242, 289, 328, 387, 420, 497, \\dots$$Hugo Pfoertner posted a PDF on the OEIS containing the best known examples.

{"query": "What is the methodology to analyze future climatic extremes using the results of climate models?What is the accepted methodology to predict future climatic extremes using the results of climate models?I have recently read a report about climatic extremes considering climate change (MICE, 2002). The report says that researchers fitted extreme value distributions (generalized extreme value, generalized Pareto) to the intensity of predicted, future climatic actions, e.g. rain, snow, wind. Applying these models, events with a large return period are used to assess the impact of climate change. Additionally, there is a recent Nature article by O’Gorman which also deals with future extreme events, particularly snow.Considering that the predictions (projections per scenarios) can be made only in probabilistic terms. I would like to know how these predictions are made, what methodology are they using? I mean the actual climatic data, not the extreme value (statistical) analysis of them. For extreme value analysis, annual or more frequent maxima be used. It is quite dubious that climate models would predict monthly or annual maxima of for a certain region, up to the end of this century (or are climate models so sophisticated?).Someone told me that on this site (Earth System Grid Federation) there is an example of daily predicted snow data (this can be downloaded).So, my main question is how this data, these predictions, are produced. What are the underlying assumptions of the models? Can these 100-year long simulations be used to predict extreme events within a 100 to 1000 year return period (these are common in engineering practice).As far as I know, the climate models contain 'accurate' models (where the phenomenon is described by differential equations) and 'approximate' models (where empirical models are used). I guess the actual amount of precipitation for a given region belongs to the latter; in this case how uncertain are these models? (Surely the 'accurate' models have large uncertainty as well, but perhaps less).I have an engineering background and I am interested in the effect of extreme climatic events on the reliability of structures; especially considering climate change. In order to study this, it would be great to know how reliable are the climate predictions regarding extreme events. If the probability distribution (or more complex probabilistic model of the actions) is given, the reliability of a structure (system) can be directly calculated. However, I am quite suspicious about the extremes predicted by the climate models.It is quite hard to navigate through the thousand pages reports and find the probably one page long section which would answer my question. I would highly appreciate if someone could explain the main aspects of methodology, basic assumptions or point me to specific references, any help regarding the original question is welcomed.MICE (2002).

Are there any new theories that could potentially explain it?There is a lot of material but no answer at the link provided.University of Hawaii material discussing the root cause of the pattern of formation of the Emperor and Hawaii chain of islandsan excerpt...  Perhaps it is even more amazing that in the past 65 million years  there has been only one such bend. Even more remarkable is the  observation that the straight portions of the chain are straight. As  we shall see below, the configuration of the plate boundaries in the  Pacific have changed dramatically during the lifetime of the Hawaiian  hotspot. If, as many geophysicists believe, subduction drives  tectonics, then how on earth can the straight parts be so straight and  move at constant velocities for tens of millions of years? The answer  to these questions remains a mystery!ADDED:  Sept 1st.  an excerpt from a link to information in the comment below. thank you MyCarta, good information:  The bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain is a prominent  feature usually attributed to a change in Pacific plate motion approx  47 Myr ago. However, global plate motion reconstructions fail to  predict the bend. Here we show how the geometry of the  Hawaiian-Emperor chain and other hotspot tracks can be explained when  we combine global plate motions with intraplate deformation and  movement of hotspot plumes through distortion by global mantle flow.  Global mantle flow models predict a southward motion of the Hawaiian  hotspot. This, in combination with a plate motion reconstruction  connecting Pacific and African plates through Antarctica, predicts the  Hawaiian track correctly since the date of the bend, but predicts the  chain to be too far west before it. But if a reconstruction through  Australia and Lord Howe rise is used instead, the track is predicted  correctly back to 65 Myr ago, including the bend. The difference  between the two predictions indicates the effect of intraplate  deformation not yet recognized or else not recorded on the ocean  floor. The remaining misfit before 65 Myr ago can be attributed to  additional intraplate deformation of similar magnitude.I don't know if that is definitive or not?I have come across this image showing the lately determined \"pattern of expansion\" the earth is undergoing:  perhaps then the quote above is indicating a \"perceived balance caused in the expansion as correctly predicting and matching the movement of the plume and plates relative to the pattern?****UPDATE Sept 24th -- Information from MyCarta** MyCarta \"I think the more recent research leans towards a combination of intraplate deformation and movement of the plume itself, combined with the plate motion, e.g.\"And about Euler plates, and Lord Howe's added in a comment below, quoted from the paper's abstract:  if a reconstruction through Australia and Lord Howe rise is used  instead, the track is predicted correctly back to 65 Myr ago,  including the bend.From the first paragraph in the paper:  Hotspots are frequently assumed to be fixed and used as a reference  frame for plate motions. However, when the Hawaiian hotspot track is  predicted from a global plate motion chain based on relative plate  motion data, and it is assumed that the Hawaiian hotspot is fixed  relative to African hotspots, it does not fit the observed track: the  predicted track is essentially straight, lies south of the Hawaiian  seamount chain, and has no feature corresponding to the  Hawaiian-Emperor bend. Explanation of this misfit requires one of the  following, or a combination of them, to be true: (1) motion of Pacific  plate hotspots, in particular more than 1,000 km south-westward motion  for the Hawaiian hotspot between ,80 Myr ago and the time of the bend  and minor southward motion after this time, (2) motion of hotspots in  the African hemisphere, (3) motion at an additional plate boundary, or  (4) deformation at a diffuse intraplate boundary not included in the  plate motion chain. Palaeomagnetic data from the Emperor chain3 yield  a southward component of Hawaiian hotspot motion more than 1,000 km  relative to the palaeomagnetic axis between ,80 and 49 Myr ago.In the rest of the paper they used 2 main models (other models were discarded). The first included only hotspot motion which is sufficient to explain discrepancies between predicted and observed hotspot tracks (e.g. Hawaiian-Emperor chain) back to 47 Ma ago, but before 47 Ma ago the predicted hotspot tracks do not include the bend. Their second model added intraplate deformation (in their reference plates Zealand) to hotspot motion and is able to predict the hotspot track all the way back to 65 Ma ago with good accuracy, including the bend, and with less accuracy (meaning that it is off too far to the west) until 85 My ago.\"Sept 24th MORE QUESTIONI'm getting the feeling tectonic plate heave and settle and patterns of interaction are the current best theory for the resulting relative motion of the Hawaii hotspot.So we are increasing the scale of the question to ask what is it that drives the schedule of the tectonic plates, such that the result is the ever so slow motion of the Hawaii hotspot.

{"query": "How has and how does the lithosphere affect climate change?The climatic system can be divided into five main components: the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the lithosphere, the cryosphere and the biosphere.All these physical systems operate at different time and spatial scales. The lithosphere, that makes the uppermost, rigid layer of the earth, is formed by a few dozens of tectonic plates that move laterally while resting on the Earth's fluid mantle (plate tectonics). The collision between lithospheric plates builds mountains, and their separation forms ocean basins where sediment is accumulated, on timescales of tens to hundreds of millions of years. Hence, it is considered that its effect on climate change is not on the same timescale as the other components of the system and is not given as much attention.Despite its low effect on the historical time-scales, undoubtedly, it poses a load on the system. Note that I am not interested on events that can in fact interact with the timescales of other climatic components. For example when land masses ocupied positions near the poles and the effect of the resulting increase in glaciation can be on the same time scale as other non-lithospheric physical phenomena. Nor am I interested in singular volcanic eruptions or activity of that sort. I am interested in how the processes such as continental drift, mountain growth, and erosion, affect climate evolution.", "query_id": 66}

I realize that even well outside the photon sphere of a black hole, there can be decay of orbits due to gravity waves, but evidently there can be a counteracting separating phenomenon well, due to stars being stripped of some mass (e.g. as described in this report of a star orbiting a black hole at a velocity of about %1 of c).So to put a number on this to make it more answerable, could a star plausibly orbit a black hole long enough and closely enough without spiralling in (or outward due to gas stripping) to make it half a billion years older in origin (according to the CMB rest frame) than it has experienced?", "query_id": 84}

Perhaps an expected outcome given that the ecosystems at the surface of the ocean are nutrient limited, therefore wasting most of the available energy due to the lack of iron, nitrogen and phosphorous mainly.For all the above, I would be inclined to think that a large volcanic winter would encompass a period of prosperity for oceanic life. Where a small decrease in solar irradiation is more than compensated by a large increase in nutrients availability. However, I haven't hear of evidence of such oceanic boom.Are there observations suggesting or disproving such oceanic booms during volcanic winter events?PS: I started pondering this question while thinking about this article, on which they found that a coastal community in South Africa didn't seem to have been affected by the Toba \"catastrophe\", but on the contrary, they seem to have benefited from it.", "query_id": 115}

But such a process occurs gradually over geological time scales. I doubt that there would be a single bad day when the whole moon disintegrates (as in -Oh, there Mt. Everest broke off and flew away!)Wouldn't the tidal tugging cause volcanism and gradually melt the moon as its (somewhat eccentric) orbit spirals inwards across the limit during millions of years?How would the melting moon deform? Would it really assume an oval shape, elongated towards the primary planet? Since the near side wants to orbit faster than the far side, wouldn't that cause the moon to spin at an accelerated rate, even if it initially was tidally locked? Would the melting, deforming and spinning save it from disintegrating further to within the Roche limit?Some examples of Roche limit crossings I know of:Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 may have broken up suddenly because it hadsuch a high velocity relative to Jupiter.Phobos will cross its Roche limit to Mars in ~50 million years. Itwill hardly be a sudden process.

What criterion can be used to reach that end?My first guess was that whilst a gas doesn't have any correlation between the positions, a liquid does, but then I realized it's a wrong answer because a gas is not necessarily an ideal gas, so it's unclear to me how I can tell whether it's a liquid or a gas if there's some correlation between the positions in the image. I tried to find the answer on the Internet and this SE, but did not succeed and humbly hope that physics experts on this SE can tell me the answer. UPDATE: Sure, the limiting cases of an ideal gas and a tightly packed liquid are easy, but what do I do in the general case? In other words, how can I deduce whether it's a liquid or a gas if the spread of distances between neighboring nuclei is moderate, that is, neither very small nor very large?", "query_id": 148}
{"query": "How often (and what type) should I reward during grooming?My SO and I have a 1.5 Standard Poodle with a great temperament. We keep her coat moderately long (not show length), so gets brushed lightly several times a day, a more serious brushing session (about 60 min) weekly, and monthly (2-3h), basically since before we even got her at 8 weeks. (edit: it often takes quite some time because I try to work slowly and methodically, so as to minimize pulling. Sometimes this means working 1cm at a time)She tolerates brushing but clearly doesn't enjoy it, especially working through tangles, wiggling, getting mouthy, trying to get away, etc., though usually after a while gives in to her fate.I'm the fun dad, but SO is the stern one, and only gives her treats at the end of a session. However, I want to give her treats frequently and randomly throughout the session  -  I'm aiming for variable ratio reinforcement schedule (I have a psychology degree, so I've done the whole 9 yards with behavioral reinforcement, classical conditioning, operant conditioning, rats with levers, etc.). SO says giving treats in the middle of grooming makes the pupper too But I think her sessions are too long and wear on the dog's patience, making the experience aversive.Toy rewarding isn't an option since toys make her go bonkers.

{"query": "What caused the high temperatures that resulted in the Cretaceous aged komatiite lavas of Gorgona Island, Colombia?According to the San Diego State University (SDSU) webpage Unusual Lava Types, komatiite is  ultramafic volcanic rocks, having very low silica contents (~40-45%) and very high $\\ce{MgO}$ contents (~18%). These lavas are exceptional not only for their compositions, but also for their very old, restricted ages. These lavas have no modern analogs.The vast majority of komatiite deposits, according to the SDSU webpage, are about 3 Ga or older in age, due to  These ancient lava flows erupted at a time when the Earth's internal heat was much greater than today, thus generating exceptionally hot, fluid lavas with calculated eruption temperatures in excess of 1,600 degrees C (2,900 degrees F).However, with many things in Science, there are exceptions - according to the SDSU webpage, Gorgona Island, Colombia has komatiite deposits that are Cretaceous in age (around 90 Ma).

{"query": "How well can we model chemical synthesis?The Materials Genome Initiative held a 2017 workshop, that led to this published report: de Pablo et al., &quot;New frontiers for the materials initiative,&quot; npj Computational Materials 5, 41 (2019). In part, this report lists various successes of the initiative, due to complementary theoretical, computational, and experimental studies. Perhaps more interestingly, it also lists several challenges for future research. One particular challenge that gets listed in several contexts is related to computational modeling of synthesis:Improving computational support for the synthesis of soft materials would be very valuable. Although significant steps have been made using machine learning to predict outcomes of simple organic reactions,36,37 extending this capability to include a larger range of chemical variety and macromolecular synthesis would democratize chemical synthesis and accelerate our validation of theories for new chemistries. Computational guidance in the iterative experimental synthesis process is also critical to future advances.38Recent advances, particularly in x-ray diffraction at high temperatures, pressures, and inert environments could allow a more quantitative understanding of the thermodynamics of crystal synthesis. This could improve computational models of nucleation and crystal formation, help optimize the synthesis of known materials, as well as drive the discovery of new non-equilibrium compounds that are only stable under narrow conditions. Computational models of synthesis would be helpful to encourage feedback between theory and synthesis and enable calculations of optimal synthetic conditions.Often synthesis is referred to as an art, which exudes respect for those active in the field, but may also signify that theory is lagging significantly behind the practice. Of course, synthesis typically occurs through rapid non-equilibrium processes, and sometimes at very elevated temperatures or in unusual atmospheres. This makes modeling such reactions beyond the scope of simple reaction equations rather challenging, and a very different proposal to the calculation of equilibrium properties of some material post-synthesis. However, smart people have made progress on difficult problems before, and it seems clear that such modeling could potentially bring new insight and advance the art itself - and perhaps the design of novel materials.Hence, I wonder:How well can we theoretically or computationally model the dynamics of synthesis today, whether of molecules or crystals? What is considered state-of-the art, and what are its limitations?Have there been any particularly striking successes or failures in this regard?Do such computations incorporate quantum physics?Personally, I am particularly interested in the case of transition metal systems (e.g. oxides). However, I'd suspect there's been considerable advances on the side of molecular and organic chemistry, where there might be a large interest in such methods from the medical industry.

So we have the case where for “my husband” we can either use “mio marito” without article, and also “il mio uomo” (my man) with the article, both meaning the same thing - the latter being less common but perfectly acceptable, as we find in Spanish too. In the plural case, it’s again “i miei mariti” and “i miei uomini”. The same goes for “my this exception is peculiar to Italian.

Thus high albedo contributes to global warming.Now, if we consider low albedo, then that means a greater portion of light is absorbed thus raising the temperature or otherwise the heat content of the body. Less light is reflected back for greenhouse gases to capture. But then absorbed heat itself contributes towards global warming.So as I understand, both low and high albedo contribute towards global warming.

Once I have an approximation of the wavefunction, I can calculate one of the many types of bond orders mentioned in the aforementioned question (such as the Wiberg bond index explained here, which only needs the orbital coefficients from the LCAO model of a wavefunction); or if I have calculated the electron density, I can use one of the many techniques of &quot;conceptual DFT&quot; from the QTAIM framework or extensions, such as in this answer. But the existence of so many of these bond-order definitions, suggests that the very simple-to-calculate Wiberg bond index is not accurate enough for some people's liking (hence the need to formulate more complicated bond-order definitions).If we wish to know the length of a bond and we are using some advanced wavefunction-based or DFT software, I suppose that we would just do geometry optimization in our quantum chemistry software anyway, which would give us an even better description of the bond lengths than some &quot;heuristic&quot; method such as assigning a bond-order.If we wish to know the strength of a bond (remembering Tyberius's famous question from 3 years ago) we could just calculate the force constant for a particular bond, as MSwart said in this answer. This may add a bit to the cost of the quantum chemistry calculation, compared to just using a simple formula like the Wiberg bond-order formula, but probably not more than all of the other painful effort that goes into doing a quantum chemistry calculation (e.g. preparing a file, doing geometry optimization, converging an SCF, converging with respect to basis set and correlation-treatment, accounting for relativity and Born-Oppenheimer breakdown, etc.), and it seems it would be much more accurate (clearly the Wiberg formula is too simple because so many more sophisticated bond-order methods have been devised afterwards).I appreciate that we might want to draw the chemical structure with all its single and double bonds, but the desire to do this hinges on the bond-order actually being truly useful, which wouldn't seem to always be the case with, for example, the Wiberg bond-order which seems to have needed added levels of seemingly un-ending further sophistication in dozens of subsequent papers.MSwarts's answer to the previous question ends with:&quot;Of course you could also compute the intrinsic force constant for thatparticular bond, with all kind of ifs and buts.

For example, in this review it is mentioned that:It should be noted that the localization functional can display, in addition to the desired global minimum, multiple local minima that do not lead to the construction of meaningful localized orbitals. Heuristically, it is also found that the WFs corresponding to these local minima are intrinsically complex, while they are found to be real, apart from a single complex phase, at the desired global minimum (provided of course that the calculations do not include spin-orbit coupling)Thus, assuming that the MLWFs I obtained are at a local minimum, I have tried some suggestions from these threads to solve this issue:Better choice of initial guess:trying different initial guesses andusing the SCDM approach (a method which doesn't require specifying an initial guess)If the system is metallic, include some unoccupied states in the procedureThe system does not seem to be metallic.But these have not solved the issue and the large imaginary components are still present in the MLWFs obtained.The above quoted literature mentions that MLWFs are supposed to be real at the global minimum, but I do not understand the reason for this. Is there a reason for the MLWFs to be real at the global minimum? Any literature regarding this would be helpful.Note: Alternatively, if there are any other methods that avoid these issues which I can use to obtain the MLWFs corresponding to the global minimum, I would also consider that an answer to my immediate problem.", "query_id": 186}

Intuitively, I'm tempted to think about this in terms of my local temperature consistently being a couple degrees warmer, which doesn't seem that significant. After all, the temperature can change by much more than 2 degrees from day to day, or even within a few hours, so having highs of 12 °C today and 17 °C tomorrow doesn't seem like a big deal compared to 10 °C today and 15 °C tomorrow.How do I understand why this comparison is wrong and how a few degrees of change translates to the dramatic impact that seems to be predicted by climate scientists?I suspect one factor is that the global temperature increases being talked about are not actually uniform at all; some places might heat up more than others, and the effect might be concentrated in smaller time periods (so a particular place might end up 10 °C hotter in the summer, for example).I'm also guessing that there could be areas in a delicate equilibrium for which a small change in the average local temperature would have major effects. For example, ice would tend to stay frozen or accumulate in a location with a -1 °C average, but it would tend to melt if the average increased to 1 °C.Are these guesses correct?

One challenge is that the planet candidate's large orbit means it would not cross in front of its binary partner again for about 70 years, thwarting any attempts for a confirming observation for decades.&quot;Unfortunately to confirm that we're seeing a planet we would likely have to wait decades to see another transit,&quot; said co-author Nia Imara of the University of California at Santa Cruz. &quot;And because of the uncertainties about how long it takes to orbit, we wouldn't know exactly when to look.&quot;Can the dimming have been caused by a cloud of gas and dust passing in front of the X-ray source?

{"query": "History of interpretation of Newton&#39;s first lawNowadays it seems to be popular among physics educators to present Newton's first law as a definition of inertial frames a statement that such frames exist. This is clearly a modern overlay. Here is Newton's original statement of the law (Motte's translation):Law I. Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniformmotion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state byforces impressed thereon.The text then continues:Projectiles persevere in their motions, so far as they are notretarded by the resistance of the air, or impelled downwards by theforce of gravity. A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetuallydrawn aside from rectilinear motion, does not cease its rotation,otherwise than as it is retarded by the air. The greater bodies of theplanets and comets, meeting with less resistance in more free spaces,preserve their motions both progressive and circular for a much longertime.And then the second law is stated.There is clearly nothing about frames of reference here. In fact, the discussion is so qualitative and nonmathematical that many modern physics teachers would probably mark it wrong on an exam.I have a small collection of old physics textbooks, and one of the more historically influential ones is Elements of Physics by Millikan and Gale, 1927. (Millikan wrote a long series of physics textbooks with various titles.) Millikan and Gale give a statement of the first law that reads like an extremely close paraphrase of the Mott translation. There is no mention of frames of reference, inertial or otherwise.A respected and influential modern textbook, aimed at a much higher level than Millikan's book, is Kleppner and Kolenkow's 1973 Introduction to Mechanics. K&amp;K has this:...it is always possible to find a coordinate system with respect towhich isolated bodies move uniformly. [...] Newton's first law ofmotion is the assertion that inertial systems exist. Newton's firstlaw is part definition and part experimental fact. Isolated bodiesmove uniformly in inertial systems by virtue of the definition of aninertial system. In contrast, that inertial systems exist is astatement about the physical world. Newton's first law raises a numberof questions, such as what we mean by an 'isolated body,' [...]There is a paper on this topic: Galili and Tseitlin, &quot;Newton's First Law: Text, Translations, Interpretations and Physics Education,&quot; Science &amp; EducationVolume 12, Number 1, 45-73, DOI: I had access to it at one time, and it seemed very relevant. Unfortunately it's paywalled now. The abstract, which is not paywalled, says,Normally, NFL is interpreted as a special case: a trivial deductionfrom Newton's Second Law. Some advanced textbooks replace NFL by amodernized claim, which abandons its original meaning.Question 1: Does anyone know more about when textbooks begain to claim that the first law was a statement of the definition existence of inertial frames?There seem to be several possible interpretations of the first law:A. Newton consciously wrote the laws of motion in the style of an axiomatic system, possibly emulating Euclid. However, this is only a matter of style. The first law is clearly a trivial deduction from the second law. Newton presented it as a separate law merely to emphasize that he was working in the framework of Galileo, not medieval scholasticism.B. Newton's presentation of the first and second laws is logically defective, but Newton wasn't able to do any better because he lacked the notion of inertial and noninertial frames of reference. Modern textbook authors can tell Newton, &quot;there, fixed that for you.&quot;C. It is impossible to give a logically rigorous statement of the physics being described by the first and second laws, since gravity is a long-range force, and, as pointed out by K&amp;K, this raises problems in defining the meaning of an isolated body. The best we can do is that in a given cosmological model, such as the Newtonian picture of an infinite and homogeneous universe full of stars, we can find some frame, such as the frame of the &quot;fixed stars,&quot; that we want to call inertial. Other frames moving inertially relative to it are also inertial. But this is contingent on the cosmological model. That frame could later turn out to be noninertial, if, e.g., we learn that our galaxy is free-falling in an external gravitational field created by other masses.Question 2: Is A supported by the best historical scholarship? For extra points, would anyone like to tell me that I'm an idiot for believing in A and C, or defend some other interpretation on logical or pedagogical grounds?[EDIT] My current guess is this. I think Ernst Mach's 1919 The Science Of Mechanics gradually began to influence presentations of the first law. Influential textbooks such as Millikan's only slightly postdated Mach's book, and were aimed at an audience that would have been unable to absorb Mach's arguments. Later, texts such as Kleppner, which were aimed at a more elite audience, began to incorporate Mach's criticism and reformulation of Newton. Over time, texts such as Halliday, which were aimed at less elite audiences, began to mimic treatments such as Kleppner's.", "query_id": 211}

{"query": "Age of Occator CraterHas any official information been published regarding the estimated age of the Occator crater on Ceres?  I ran some quick searches but couldn't find anything putting a definitive (or even speculative) date on the moment of impact.I ask because based upon my own very amateur analysis of the imagery:...there seems to be a marked decrease in the amount of secondary cratering visible within a fairly uniform radius of the main crater.  My assumption is that when the impact occurred, the surrounding area was likely blanketed by material kicked up from the impact site, obscuring most pre-existing craters (smaller ones, in particular).  Kind of like fresh snowfall, except made of rock.  So for a (small) secondary crater to be visible near Occator, the impact would have to have occurred after the impact that created Occator crater.  Meaning that the relative lack of small craters near Occator would seem to imply a fairly recent impact (\"recent\" in terms of Ceres geological timescales), I believe?Is there any official data that would confirm or refute this?", "query_id": 213}

{"query": "How can linear oceanic ridges (like the East Pacific Rise) be explained by single point mantle plumes?I'm a bit confused about how divergent boundaries between tectonic plates work, or just why plates move. I've read that these ridges that are in the place of divergent boundaries are created when magma arises from the mantle convection, probably powered by a mantle plume. This creates a hotspot, but in every illustration I have seen, they use these plumes or just the mantle convection force to explain why plates move apart each other:Here, that convection of the mantle is used to explain the formation of a ridge and why the plates move apart.However, this is easy to understand with a cross section of the Earth like in that picture. But I can't wrap my head around the idea of this phenomenon creating the linear ridges we see extending across thousands of kilometers, like the East Pacific Rise. Because, that \"ridge\" we see in the above picture is just an elevation seen in a cross section of the Earth, that could very well be just a volcano or a single oceanic mountain, not a linear ridge of continental dimensions.I mean this:That can't be produced by a single mantle plume, right? Because a mantle plume is just in one spot. Is the convection force of the mantle rising across that entire line that is kilometers wide, creating a linear mantle plume? If that last one is the case, I would be even more confused about the shape of the convection cells in the mantle. Or are there multiple individual mantle plumes conveniently aligned across and beneath that ridge?So, I don't understand how the ridge is formed. Because the first picture helps me only to understand how a single elevation spot is created, like an underwater mountain, or a volcano, or even a volcanic island, but not an entire ridge.Now, I do know that the chain of Hawaiian islands up to Siberia was created due to the tectonic plate passing above a plume, or just a hotspot, and that created the entire \"ridge\". But are all oceanic ridges formed in that same way? Due to a single plume creating a hotspot and the plate moving above it drawing the ridge as it passes? Or is this a different process?

{"query": "Ice skating, how does it really work?Some textbooks I came across, and a homework assignment I had to do several years ago, suggested that the reason we can skate on ice is the peculiar $p(T)$-curve of the ice-water boundary.

It was then mentioned as fun fact that you could ice-skate on a planet with lakes of frozen dioxide because that gas has the $p(T)$-curve the other way round.My calculations at that time told me that this was, pardon my french, bollocks.

This is not a really high value, but it is still much more as the mean proportion of the Uranium in the whole Earth.So, first I think the general siderophility of Uranium is not a reason to not have a lot of cubic kilometers of solved U in the outer core.Second, what I think: trying to mix unmixable liquids they we will have separate phases of solutions in the order of their density. Also, trying to mix uranium and iron liquid, we will haveA phase of solution of uranium in iron (higher)Below that, a solution of iron in uranium.At least one of them will be also a saturated solution.So, I don't see any reason, why wouldn't the Uranium concentrate in the outer crust.

Sweeping all the other problems of constructing such a beast under the rug, wouldn't this violate causality?SR says that the simultaneity and relative ordering of events is dependent on the relative motion of the observer, but that no matter how it works out, if event A causes event B, no observer will see B first.

{"query": "Counterexamples in algebraic topology?In this threadBooks you would like to read (if somebody would just write them...),I expressed my desire for a book with the title \"(Counter)examples in Algebraic Topology\". My reason for doing so was that while the abstract formalism of algebraic topology is very well-explained in many textbooks and while most graduate students are fond of the general machinery, the study of examples is somehow neglected. I am looking for examples that explain why certain hypotheses are necessary for theorems to hold. The books by Hatcher and Bredon contain some interesting stuff in this direction, and there is Neil Strickland's bestiary, which is mainly focused on positive knowledge.To convey an idea of what I am after, here are a few examples from my private ''counterexamples in algebraic topology'' list. Some are surprising, some less so.The abelianization of $SL_2 (Z)$ is the map $BSL_2(Z) \\to is a homology equivalence to a simple space. But it is not a Quillen plus construction, since the the homotopy fibre is $BF_2$ (free group on $2$ generators), hence not acyclic. See The free group $F_2$ has index 12 in  SL(2,$\\mathbb{Z}$) .Maps $f:X \\to Y$ which are homology equivalences, the homotopy groups are abstractly isomorphic, but though, $f$ is not a homotopy equivalence (a number of examples has been given in the answers to these questions:Spaces with same homotopy and homology groups that are not homotopy equivalent?, Are there pairs of highly connected finite CW-complexes with the same homotopy groups?).Self-maps of simply-connected spaces $X$ which are the identity on homotopy, but not on homology (let $X=K(Z;2) \\times K(Z;4)$, $u:K(Z;2) \\to K(Z;4)$ be the cup square,and $f:X\\to X$ is given by $f(x,y):= (x,y + u(x))$, using that EM-spaces are abelian groups). There are also self-maps of finite simply connected complexes that are the identity on homology, but not on homotopy, see Diarmuid Crowleys answer to Cohomology of fibrations over the circle: how to compute the ring structure?The stabilization map $B \\Sigma_{\\infty} \\to B \\Sigma_{\\infty}$ induces a bijection on free homotopy classes $[X, B \\Sigma_{\\infty}]$ for each finite CW space $X$. However, it is not a homotopy equivalence (not a $\\pi_1$-isomorphism).The fibration $S^1 \\to B \\mathbb{Q} \\to B is classified by a map $f:B \\to CP^{\\infty}$, which can be assumed to be a fibration with fibre $B \\mathbb{Q}$. Now let $X_n$ be the preimage of the n-skeleton of $CP^{\\infty}$. Using the Leray-Serre spectral sequence, we can compute the integralhomology of $X_n$ and, by the universal coefficient theorem, the homology of field coefficients. It turns out that this is finitely generated for any field,and so we can define the Euler characteristic in dependence of the field. It is not independent of the field in this case (the reason is of course that the integral homology of $X_n$ is not finitely generated).The compact Lie groups $U(n)$ and  $S^1 \\times SU(n)$ are diffeomorphic, their classifying spaces have isomorphic cohomology rings and homotopy groups, but the classifying spaces are not homotopy equivalent (look at Steenrod operations). Question: Which examples of spaces and maps of a similar flavour do you know and want to share with the other MO users?To focus this question, I suggest to stay in the realm of algebraic topology proper. In other words:The properties in question should be homotopy invariant properties of This includes of course fibre bundles, viewed as maps to certain classifying spaces.Let us talk about spaces of the homotopy type of CW complexes, to avoid that a certain property fails for point-set topological reasons.This excludes the kind of examples from the famous book \"Counterexamples in Topology\".The examples should not be \"counterexamples in group theory\" in disguise. Any ugly example of a discrete group $G$ gives an equally ugly example of a space $BG$. Same applies to rings via Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectra.I prefer examples from unstable homotopy theory.To get started, here are some questions whose answer I do not know:Construct two simply-connected CW complexes $X$ and $Y$ such that $H^* (X;F) \\cong H^* (Y;F)$ for any field, as rings and modules over the Steenrod algebras, but which are not homotopy equivalent. EDIT: Appropriate Moore spaces do the job, see Eric Wofsey's answer.Let $f: X \\to Y$ be a map of CW-complexes. Assume that $[T,X] \\to [T;Y]$ is a bijection for each finite CW complex $T$ ($[T,X]$ denotes free homotopy classes). What assumptions are sufficient to conclude that $f$ is a weak homotopy equivalence? EDIT: the answer has been given by Tyler Lawson, see below.Do there exist spaces $X,Y,Z$ and a homotopy equivalence $X \\times Y \\to X \\times Z$, without $Y$ and $Z$ being homotopy equivalent? Can I require these spaces to be finite CWs? EDIT: without the finiteness assumptions, this question was ridiculously simple.Do you know examples of fibrations $F \\to E \\to X$, such that the integral homology of all three spaces is finitely generated (so that the Euler numbers are defined) and such that the Euler number is not multiplicative, i.e. $\\chi(E) \\neq \\chi(F) \\chi(X)$? Remark: is $X$ is assumed to be simply-connected, then the Euler number is multiplicative (absolutely standard). Likewise, if $X$ is a finite CW complex and $F$ is of finite homological type (less standard, but a not so hard exercise). So any counterexample would have to be of infinite type. The above fibration $BSL_2 (Z) \\to is a counterexample away from the primes $2,3$, but do you know one that does the job in all characteristics?. Of course, the ordinary Euler number is the wrong concept here.I am looking forward for your answers.EDIT: so far, I have gotten great answers, but mostly for the specific questions I asked. My intention was to create a larger list of counterexamples. So, feel free to mention your favorite strange spaces and maps.", "query_id": 236}

In other words, is the whole temperature argument a red herring?EDIT (to clarify question):To determine the Earth's mean surface temperature, we can employ one of these methods:Measure the Earth's temperature at every point and average. Of course, this is physically impossible, since a point is a 0-dimensional mathematical abstraction, but we can do something close with satellites.Select a large number of random points on the Earth's surface (this random distribution is uniform in longitude, but not in latitude-- in latitude, it would look like a cosine curve), measure the temperature, and average. In addition to giving us a mean, it would give us a standard deviation so we can say \"we are 95% confident that the Earth's true mean temperature is X plus or minus Y\".Take a uniformly spaced grid (non trivial, since the distance between longitudes vary by latitude), measure the temperature at those points and average. This is similar to the first approach, but with fewer points. Unless we believe our grid points introduce a bias, this should be as accurate as random sampling.My problem: temperature measurements in the past were made using NONE of these methods. The points where temperature was measured were not chosen randomly or in a gridded fashion. Therefore, how can they be an accurate measurement of historical temperature, even if we only consider temperature changes?NOTE: I realize surface temperature isn't the best measure of global warming, since water has a much higher specific heat than land (among other things), but that's my focus for this question.", "query_id": 257}

So the only source I currently have on the subject is Wikipedia. Nevertheless I suspect this question is appropriate since I don't remember it being addressed in other textbooksNaively, computation of the Casimir pressure leads to infinite sums and therefore requires regularization. Several regulators can be used that yield the same answer: zeta-function, heat kernel, Gaussian, probably other too. The question is:  What is the mathematical reason all regulators yield the same answer?In physical terms it means the effect is insensitive to the detailed physics of the UV cutoff, which in realistic situation is related to the properties of the conductors used. The Wikipedia mentions that for some more complicated geometries the effect is sensitive to the cutoff, so why for the classic parallel planes example it isn't?EDIT: Aaron provided a wonderful Terry Tao ref relevant to this issue. From this text is clear that the divergent sum for vacuum energy can be decomposed into a finite and an infinite part, and that the finite part doesn't depend on the choice of regulator. However, the infinite part does depend on the choice of regulator (see eq 15 in Tao's text). Now, we have another parameter in the problem: the separation between the conductor planes L. What we need to show is that the infinite part doesn't depend on L. This still seams like a miracle since it should happen for all regulators. Moreover, unless I'm confused it doesn't work for the toy example of a massless scalar in 2D.

{"query": "Can Lagrangian be thought of as a metric?My question is, can the (classical) Lagrangian be thought of as a metric? That is, is there a meaningful sense in which we can think of the least-action path from the initial to the final configuration as being the shortest one? Then the equations of motion would be geodesics - not in physical space, but in phase space, with the metric defined by the Lagrangian. Below is a slightly expanded outline of this idea, outlining why I think it might make sense.(Classical) Lagrangian mechanics is derived by assuming the system takes the path of minimum action from its initial state to its final one. In the formalism of classical mechanics we normally write time $t$ as a special type of coordinate, quite distinct from the other (generalised) coordinates $\\mathbf{q}$. However, if we want we can lump these together into a single set of \"generalised space-time coordinates\" $\\mathbf{r} = (t, q_0, q_1, \\dots)$, to be considered a vector space of dimension $1+n$, where $n$ is the number of degrees of freedom. Then the action is just a function of curves in $\\mathbf{r}$-space, and the equations of motion are determined by choosing the least-action path between two points, $\\mathbf{r_0}$ and $\\mathbf{r_1}$. In this picture, $L$ depends upon the position and direction of the curve at each point along it, and the action is obtained by a line integral along the curve.This has a pleasingly geometrical feel, and so my question is, is there a meaningful sense in which I can think of the least-action path as being the shortest path, with the Lagrangian playing the role of a metric on $\\mathbf{r}$-space? Or is there some technical reason why $L$ can't be thought of as a metric in this sense?Note that this isn't in general the same as a metric defined on space-time. For an $m$-particle system in $3+1$ space-time, $\\mathbf{r}$ will have $3m+1$ dimensions, rather than 4.

By this I do not mean the symmetry numbers (the \"quark content\"), but the actual dynamics, some insight.The pions are the sloshing of the up-down condensate, and the other pseudoscalars by extending to strangeness. Their couplings are by soft-particle theorems. The eta-prime is their frustrated friend, weighed down by the instanton fluid. The rho and omega are the gauge fields for flavor SU(2), and A1(1260) gauges the axial SU(2), and they have KaluzaKlein-like echoes at higher energies, these can decay into the appropriate \"charged\" hadrons with couplings that depend on the flavor symmetry multiplet. The proton and the neutron are the topological defects. That accounts for everything up to 1300 but a few scalars and the b1.There are scalars starting at around 1300 MeV which are probably some combination of glue-condensate sloshing around and quark-condensate sloshing around, some kind of sound in the vacuum glue. Their mass is large, their lifetime is not that big, they have sharp decay properties.On the other hand, there is nothing in which should correspond to the or (what seems to be) its strange counterpart f0(980). While looking around, I found this discussion: The literature that it pointed to suggests that the sigma is a very unstable bound state of pions (or, if you like, tetraquarks).This paper gives strong evidence for an actual pole; another gives a more cursory review. The location of the pole is far away from the real axis, the width is larger than the mass by 20% or so, and the mass is about 400MeV. The authors though are confident that it is real because they tell me that the interpolation the interactions of pions is safe in this region because their goldstone properties dominate the interactions. I want to believe it, but how can you be sure?I know this particle was controversial. I want to understand what kind of picture this is giving. The dispersion subtraction process is hard for me to visualize in terms of effective fields, and the result is saying that there is an unstable bound state.Is there a physical picture of the sigma which is more field theoretical, perhaps even just an effective potential for pions?

There, or in the nice exposition given in Hairer &amp; Wanner (1996, 2nd printing, pp.49-50), one sees that he was squaring the circle in an elaborate way which has nothing to do with $(1)$.Of course Leibniz must have become aware of $(1)$ and $(2)$ at some point, as (later!) inventor of the notation that makes them almost automatic. Unfortunately, I can’t find any written evidence of that. Maybe someone else will have better luck!(The closest I can find is a 1707 letter of Wolff to Leibniz, where the new notation is used to write in effect that $d\\theta = dt:(1+t^2)$, and then deduce $(2)$ and $(3)$. The two correspondents may well have had in mind the modern proof $(1)$ of this differential relation, but neither says so.)I can’t find it in Jacob Bernoulli:With Leibniz notation spreading, one might think that a disciple would write $(1)$ at the first opportunity. But that’s not what Jacob B. does to rectify a unit circle in Positionum de Seriebus Infinitis Pars Tertia (Basel, 1696, Prop.

And in later papers (1712, 1719) Bernoulli is content to describe this relation as “well-known”.I can’t find it in de Moivre:Schneider (1968, footnotes 248 &amp; 250) seems to claim that a 1708 letter of de Moivre to Bernoulli has the proof $(1)$ and also the “Euler” formula $\\theta=\\smash{\\frac1i}\\log(\\cos\\theta+i\\sin\\theta)$. But this is not borne out by the letter’s text in (1931, pp.241-257): there, as also in his paper (1703, p.1124) and book (1730, p.44), de Moivre simply states $\\smash{d\\theta=\\frac{dt}{1+t^2}}$ without proving it anew.I can’t find it in Euler:Euler was of course well aware of $(2)$, which appears for instance in his fifth paper (1729, pp.93, 95) and in his later E60, 65, 66, 125, 129, 130, 162, 217, 391, 475, 482, etc. But when it comes to proving $(2)$ or $(3)$, then again he seems to eschew $(1)$:In his precalculus book (1748, §§139-140) he chooses to first establish Bernoulli’s above formula$$\\theta = \\frac1{2i}\\log\\frac{1+it}{1-it}\\tag4$$(this he does by multiplying numerator and denominator by $\\cos\\theta$ so they become $e^{\\pm i\\theta}$), and then to deduce $(3)$ by plugging $it$ in the series for $\\smash{\\log\\frac{1+x}{1-x}}$. None of this requires $(1)$, $(2)$, or any calculus.In his differential calculus book (1755, §§194-197) he first differentiates a similar logarithmic formula for $\\theta = \\sin^{-1}(s)$, namely $\\theta = -i\\log(\\sqrt{1-s^2} + is)$, to obtain$$d\\theta = \\frac{ds}{\\sqrt{1-s^2}}.\\tag5$$Plugging $s = into $(5)$ then gives him $(2)$. He might as well have differentiated $(4)$ directly! Either way, $(1)$ is not used, although to be fair, Euler at least gives (§195) an alternative proof of $(5)$ using the argument $(1)$, but applied to $\\smash{\\sin^{-1}}$ instead of $\\smash{\\tan^{-1}}$.So where can you find it?It’s in Lacroix (1797, pp.113-114) and its progeny.

{"query": "Were there any plans or proposals for &quot;unilateral geoengineering deployments&quot; before this paper was publsihed?I saw the catchy Phys.org news title Artificially cooling planet 'risky strategy,' new research shows and then looked at the open access article, in Nature Communications (14-Nov-2017 online) Impacts of hemispheric solar geoengineering on tropical cyclone frequency, Jones et al. geoengineering refers to a range of proposed methods for counteracting global warming by artificially reducing sunlight at Earth’s surface. The most widely known solar geoengineering proposal is stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), which has impacts analogous to those from volcanic eruptions. Observations following major volcanic eruptions indicate that aerosol enhancements confined to a single hemisphere effectively modulate North Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) activity in the following years. Here we investigate the effects of both single-hemisphere and global SAI scenarios on North Atlantic TC activity using the HadGEM2-ES general circulation model and various TC identification methods. We show that a robust result from all of the methods is that SAI applied to the southern hemisphere would enhance TC frequency relative to a global SAI application, and vice versa for SAI in the northern hemisphere. Our results reemphasise concerns regarding regional geoengineering and should motivate policymakers to regulate large-scale unilateral geoengineering deployments. (emphasis added)The paper seems to warn against single-hemisphere solar geoengineering. Was that the plan to begin with, and nobody until now thought that cooling one hemisphere but not the other one might be problematic?Or is this paper simply stating something more common-sense, for example &quot;if you do it wrong, it won't work right&quot;.Was there in fact any plan for unilateral geoengineering deployments before this was published, or is there a bit of grandstanding along with the science?", "query_id": 280}

This notion of &#8220;boundary&#8221; is of course quite vague.  The point we wish to make is this: No matter how we make this notion precise, the conjecture is false.  Exercises 11(b) and 12(b) may serve as illustrations.Exercise 11(b) states that if $\\sum_n a_n$ is a divergent series of positive reals, then $\\sum_n also diverges, where $s_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_n$.  Exercise 12(b) states that if $\\sum_n a_n$ is a convergent series of positive reals, then $\\sum_n converges, where $r_n = \\sum_{i\\ge n} a_i$.Although these two exercises are suggestive, they are not enough to convince me of Rudin&#8217;s strong claim that no matter how we make this notion precise, the conjecture is false.

{"query": "How is land subsidence measured?When groundwater is pumped out of the ground by wells, and not replenished fast enough, the groundwater level sinks. With it, the surface of the area sinks also. Locally, this effect is not apparent, because heights of objects are specified relative to the surface. The change in height stays zero by definition. But relative to the average elevation of surrounding land not connected in terms of ground water, there is a change. What changes is the distance between soil surface and center of gravity of the earth. The subsidence is a change in the shape of the earth, so its center of gravity changes itself, but the magnitude of that change is small enough compared to the surface change to ignore it. How can the change in surface elevation of a fixed point on the surface of the Earth be measured?One approach would be to use the fact that the surface of a water volume in equilibrium is the same height everywhere, even if the surface is separated. The water level in both ends of a U-shaped pipe is the same. One could use a long pipe that reaches from the measured location to a reference point. Connected bodies of groundwater are large, so that may require pipes of a length in the order of kilometers. Also, with a large distance between the end the air pressure may be different, so there is no equilibrium. The ground water level itself is a possible reference point, because the ground water can permeate the ground. But we know that it is not in equilibrium, because ground water is removed only in parts of the surface - the wells, and the permeation is slow.Ground elevation can be measured from satellites, as GPS does. I suspect that the accuracy is too low for many purposes because the relative change in the measured distance is very small. Also, the orbit of a satellite changes with the change of the center of gravity. Because the change is slow, elevation changes in distant regions influencing the satellite create noise in the measurement.", "query_id": 302}

Then we conclude it came from the death of the small star. But how? We know the small stars never go through fusion that produce carbon. So low mass stars could not have brought this. Some mention planetary nebula but I don't get it.Would appreciate a nice explanation.EDIT as planetmaker said in the comments, high mass star go through supernova explosion which releases contents (Wikipedia mentions outer layers, but I guess outer layers contain carbon). Does the carbon and other heavy elements get released from the death of small stars as well, and if so, how? Since carbon never is produced in the small star formation and in its fusion.", "query_id": 320}

I infer from this that the structure has to be well-relaxed (zero forces).Does this mean that we can't use a different functional for the frequency-dependent dielectric function calculation (both electronic and ionic) than the one used to relax the structure?For context, I would typically use PBE to do structure relaxations and compute band structures with a hybrid.

She uses two actual cannons to simulate those massive impacts. Here's one firing in her lab at UC Davis.Unidentified Person:  Firing in three, two, one.Soundbite of Cannon FIringAri Shapiro, Host: Her work earned her a spot in this year's class of MacArthur Fellows. Many of us call it the genius grant. For years, experts have thought that Earth's moon formed after a large collision knocked off a bunch of rock. Stewart told me her research suggests a different story.Planetary Scientist Sarah Stewart: During planet formation, when two bodies collide, there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized. That means that a rocky planet like Earth is mostly rock vapor.Shapiro: What is rock vapor, and what does that have to do with our moon?Stewart: Rock vapor is taking the rocks that we stand on and heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas. And when that occurs, the Earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense. And it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the Earth today. And we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the Earth after a giant impact.Shapiro: So the moon actually came from the Earth.Stewart: The moon grows within the rock vapor of the Earth. And that gives the moon the same chemistry as the Earth.We don't learn about &quot;rock vapor&quot; in Earth Science class, but I know it's got to be a lot hotter than the lava we see in the news. A significant fraction of Earth's crust is SiO₂ based and it's boiling point is roughly 3,000°C, and I have a hunch the temperatures involved here are much much higher than that. The kinetic energy associated with say a relative velocity of 40 is roughly 8 eV per AMU, over 130 eV for every oxygen atom for example.So does &quot;rock vapor&quot; start out as a highly ionized &quot;rock plasma&quot; with almost no covalent bonds remaining, or does most of the energy of the original impactor get transferred to a much greater mass of Earth?Is there a good place to read about her and her students' MacArthur grant-getting research described in the podcast?", "query_id": 328}

{"query": "Would warp bubbles emit gravitational Cerenkov radiation in general relativity?Inspired by the gravtiomagnetic analogy, I would expect that just as a charged tachyon would emit normal (electromagetic) Cerenkov radiation, any mass-carrying warp drive would emit gravitational Cerenkov radiation. The gravitomagnetic approximation may well break down near the mass, but \"sufficiently far\" from it, this would still be valid. Is that correct?Specifically, let's suppose there is a moving closed surface S, such that on and outside S the gravitomagnetic equations are approximately valid (no assumptions about interior), such that it moves with a velocity greater than $c$, and such that it \"carries mass\", in the sense that the closed surface intergral of the gravitational field strength around S is negative (net inward gravitational field).In general relativity, is this situation even possible? If so, would it emit gravitational radiation? If so, how fast would it lose energy (mass)?I am motivated by the recent media hype around the Alcubierre metric. Nevertheless, it is a general question applying to any proposed \"moving warp bubble\" solution of general relativity. (As opposed to, say, a pair of \"stargates\", or a \"warp corridor\", or whatever -- if a mass $M$ travels through a stargate, it might be that the gate through which it enters could get heavier by $M$, and the gate through which it leaves could get lighter by $M$.

The paradox is resolved by saying that classical electrodynamics alone is not an adequate description of phenomena within the atom, so a quantum description is required. Or, to put it another way, hydrogen exists although it oughtn't, \"because quantum physics\". All this is uncontroversial.But what about gravitational radiation?The proton and electron form a mutually gravitating system, with the gravitational attraction between them being some $10^{-43}$ times the electrostatic attraction. Like any mutually orbiting masses, they must therefore emit gravitational radiation. Blindly following the formula in Wikipedia, the power radiated appears to be $7.4\\times{10^{-188}}$ watts, or $4.6\\times{10^{-169}}$ eV per second.I don't have time to wait several times $10^{169}$ seconds to see how hydrogen atoms age, so I thought it would be quicker to ask here.Do we genuinely predict that hydrogen will emit gravitational radiation at approximately this rate, or does the \"because quantum physics\" override apply to gravitational radiation just as it applies to electromagnetic radiation?What would it even mean, in the context of a hydrogen atom, where electrostatic forces predominate, for the atom to lose energy by gravitational radiation?

Say there is equilibrium, i.e. no net heat flow, why can the entropy not be sitting at a non-maximal value? From the second law of thermodynamics, it follows that $S$ never gets smallerand of course I know that for an isolated system there are many statements involving $\\text{d}S=\\frac{\\delta Q}{T}$, which say what might happen for processes. But if I have equilibrium, then no relevant processes are going on.  Some proofs in thermodynamics involve arguments how if we don't have maximal entropy, then we can do something which raises entropy. But why is that relevant or related equilibrium, i.e. to the positions for the termodynamic parameters, which don't change with time? One could argue that probably the energy $U$ doesn't sit at the minimal value, but in thermodynamics, without microscopic forces, the statement that the energy changes towards equilibrium and seeks its minimal value seems to be derived from maximal entropy.And how can I conclude the converse? Why does equilibrium follow from $\\text{d}S=0$?(edit: I see the question was just bumped on the front page, and as it's a year old now, I guess my interest in the topic has changed in so far as I'm not particularly happy with the formulation of the initial question anymore. That is, I guess without proper stating the definitions, it might be difficult to give a good answer - the thing I still don't \"like\", and that might be kind of a language problem, is that \"to maximize\" implies that there is a family of values it could take - but it takes the maximum - while at the same time, you often consider a deviation away from a thermodynamical state to be a transition into a configuration where thermodynamics doesn't apply anymore. Hence, if you go away from the \"maximal value\", you might lose the concept of there being a temperature at all, but since this is what makes the parameter space with respect you use the word \"maximal\" entropy, you get into language problems. But at least I do see it's use in explainaing how the evolves once you take the extensive parameters into your control and change the system quasistatically.

When NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope observed odd changes in the sunlight Nix was reflecting, researchers realized that Nix does not rotate predictably like Earth’s moon.

The same chaos afflicts Hydra, another tiny Pluto moon. Watch the video to see an animation showing Nix’s wobbles as it orbits Pluto.I was wondering if knowing more about their chaotic behaviour can help us advance Astronomy?Personally, I believe we wouldn’t gain much from knowing more about their movement since chaotic movements become very different even for minute changes in the parameters.If there are any applications or conclusions from this though, I’d like to know what they are.", "query_id": 364}

For diophantine equations there seem not to be such a direct link to other areas.I would like to roughly understand why the attention of number theorists concentrates on some kinds of diophantine equations and not on others. Why an equation such as $x^2-ny^2=1$or$x^3+y^3=z^3$is (or have been) considered worth studying, and not, say, any other random variant such as (if that specific example is not enough nontrivial for you or if it actually happens to have been studied, feel free to substitute it with your favourite \"random\" diophantine equation):$x^3+y^5=z^2$  ?

{"query": "Does a tower bell ringing prevent thunderstorms?IntroductionThis is the beginning of an apparently physics-unrelated question, which involves 1700-1800 Italian law, atmospheric processes, sound waves propagating through fluid and clouds, and lightning strikes burning down churches.The core of the question is figuring out if and how a sound wave influences the formation disruption of clouds and eventual thunderstorms.Background and ContextI live next to the European Alps, in northern Italy. Here weather is often cloudy and thunderstorms are not rare. For religious purposes, every town in this area has a church with a tall bell tower alongside it. And of course, a huge bronze bell hangs in each tower to ring every hour.I've talked to a local elderly (who happens to manage the bell tower) about thunderstorms, and I was told that when a thunderstorm approaches he rings the bell repeatedly and vigorously to try to &quot;break up the storm&quot;, in order to supposedly avoid rain and thunder falling on the town. This is a practice still widely used to this day in this area. Me being a engineering student, I wanted to figure out if that really made sense and what effects ringing the bell really had.Question formalizationA bronze bell ringing multiple times produces sound. The kinetic energy of the bronze clapper is cast on the bell, which converts it into sound energy.Specifically, the bronze bell vibrates and transfers the sharp vibration to the layer of air molecules wrapped around the bell, which initiates a chain transmission. This produces sound waves, which are longitudinal (compression) waves transmitted through a fluid (air).Longitudinal waves are waves in which the vibration of the medium isparallel (&quot;along&quot;) to the direction the wave travels and displacementof the medium is in the same (or opposite) direction of the wavepropagation. Mechanical longitudinal waves are also calledcompressional or compression waves, because they produce compressionand rarefaction when traveling through a medium, and pressure waves,because they produce increases and decreases in pressure. [source]Those waves are then spread out more or less spherically (following the inverse square law) from the bell top point.The natural questions to ask at this point are:What happens when the sound wave passes through the cloud?Does the wave have enough energy to reasonably alter the formation of the cloud and therefore prevent allow the thunderstorm?Is there such thing as &quot;breaking up the storm&quot; or is it just a popular belief?I genuinely have no idea since I have no first hand experience with this.Thunderstorm formation looks like a whole different process, and I can't seem to find a connection with sound waves.Thunderstorms form when warm, moist air rises into cold air. The warmair becomes cooler, which causes moisture, called water vapor, to formsmall water droplets - a process called condensation. The cooled airdrops lower in the atmosphere, warms and rises again. [source]Historically relevant experimentsWhile doing my research I found papers from the late 1700s where Italian scientist were trying to answer one of our questions: does ringing the tower bell disrupt an incoming thunderstorm?Their answer is the opposite of what I expected: they thought that ringing the bell actually amplified the storm.You can find the original version of these papers hereTheir results look extremely nonrigorous, but it can be a starting point to reflect on.Note: I can do a full translation of the paper if someone is interested, right now I'll do my best to translate and summarize the key concepts (sparing you a ton of mid-1700 religious and legal drama)Paper published in 1770Key: Total nonsenseThe vibration induced by the bell sharp sound has 2 effects on air: itrubs together different parts [of the cloud] and it thins out the mass[of the cloud]. The rubbing, as it is known, awakens the &quot;electricfire&quot; (I have no clue about what that is). The thinning out attractsit [the electric fire], diminishing air resistence. Vibrations ingeneral unite instead of breaking up.It is also said that the bell sound (while storming) attracts the lightning strikes on the tower bell (which is pure nonsense), instead of letting lightning target houses or fields, and it is thought to be a good thing.Plus, the bell sound would warn locals that a storm is approaching.Act of 1783Key: Law prohibits ringing bells during stormsA series of sad experiences says that the tower bell ring, instead ofdissipating the clouds and the storms, activates and puts in dangerthe towers and the churches, which have been subject to numerousstrikes, fires and deaths during storms. It is therefore prohibited toring bells during storms.Paper published in 1787:Key: Evaluation of air vibration effects on cloudsThis paper exposes 2 reasons backing up the law against ringing bells during storms.1: Atmospheric Sound Ondulations.Vibrations originated frompercussion of objects propagate spherically, generating &quot;compressionand approachment of parts&quot;. Not heavy clouds break under thiscondition. But a cloud is a electrified conductor. It is known thatthe stress exercised from the electric fire is inversely proportionalto its capacity, and its capacity is directly proportional to thesurface area. If the cloud volume decreases, its surface area mustdecrease too. Therefore, the capacity will decrease and the intensityof the electric fire will increase.  From this we can infer thatvibrations, which compress the volume of a cloud, necessarily increasethe intensity of the electric fire, which will discharge on theclosest bodies, thus on the bell tower.2: Air rarity around bell tower. Vibrations continuously remove air and turn it into thinner and thinner air. There is therefore anair current towards the sound source. The electric fire will followthat direction.It ends with:It is demonstrated that ringing the bell promotes the striking of a lightning and targets the strike on the source of the vibrations.", "query_id": 373}

By the end of the -200 production the JT8D-17R was up to 17,400lb.st. thrust.Auxiliary inlet doors were fitted to early JT8D's [sic] around the nose cowl. These were spring loaded and opened automatically whenever the pressure differential between inlet and external static pressures was high, ie slow speed, high thrust conditions (takeoff) to give additional engine air and closed again as airspeed increased causing inlet static pressure to rise.In contrast, the JT8Ds installed on other types of aircraft, so far as I can tell, do not have suck-in doors:DC-9(Image by Cory W.

The nearest planet was Anacreon, 8 parsecs (26 light years)  away. Being on the fringe of the galaxy, there are almost no stars in  the sky.Since the planet hosted the first Foundation it is clearly habitable (i.e. atmosphere, no extreme temperatures). However, I am wondering how could it have so little metals if it seems so similar to Earth (habitability-wise) which has lots of metals. Is this possible in our Universe?

Nellis 2017 explains how coupling between the rotational motion and convective dynamo motions in the Earth's outer core cause the magnetic axis to drive towards alignment to the spin axis:Because rotational motion (RM) of Earth is strongly coupled into convective dynamo (CD) motions of its fluid-Fe outer core, planetary RM stabilizes convective motions that generate a dipolar magnetic field. If a convective fluctuation occurs which tends to destabilize a given dipolar axis, then strong RM-CD coupling either drives convective motions that essentially restore the initial orientation or CD fluctuations that drive the initial magnetic axes out of orientational equilibrium are so strong that RM-CD coupling eventually drives the dipolar axis into an alignment anti-parallel to its initial non-axisymmetric magnetic fieldsThe magnetic generation near the surface, as well as the H-HE envelope (again according to Nellis) means that:local convective dynamo motions of fluids that produce the magnetic fields are essentially decoupled from global rotational motions [...].

All the proofs I have found fall into one of these classes:Proofs of an analogous statement where $\\mathrm{Ho}(\\mathrm{Top}_*)$ is replaced by its subcategory of pointed connected spaces.Proofs which purport to prove the above statment, but which actually implicitly assume all spaces are connected at some point.  (It's sometimes hard to tell whether a given proof falls into this class or the previous one, since some classical algebraic topologists seem to use \"space\" to mean \"connected pointed space\".)Proofs that all cohomology theories are representable by a spectrum.  Here the suspension axiom implies that the behavior on connected spaces determines the whole theory.The issue is that the collection of pointed spheres $\\{S^n | n\\ge 0\\}$ is not a strongly generating set for all of $\\mathrm{Ho}(\\mathrm{Top}_*)$: a weak equivalence of pointed spaces is still required to induce isomorphisms of homotopy groups with all basepoints, whereas mapping out of pointed spheres detects only homotopy groups at the specified basepoint (and hence at any other basepoint in the same component).Is the above version of the theorem true, without connectedness hypotheses?

We will eventually run out. In the United States, I see many politicians point out fact A but struggle to get any overwhelming support for such ideas from the American public, which has instead elected as its president a person who is described in fact B. Why don't these politicians instead employ fact C which, unlike fact A, is obvious and uncontested across the political spectrum? After all, if people are told that fossil fuels are a limited ressource, the obvious response is that we must manage that ressource for the important aspects of our society. Then by managing that ressource, we accomplish the same thing that climate change prevention policies due: a limitation of our fossil fuel usage. The only difference is that now we've accomplished it without making it about the climate. Rather, we're just doing something logical and rational: we have this thing that we all really like, and we're soon going to run out, so let's not use so much of it and also try to focus on what we might be able to substitute it with (aka renewable energy).I think anybody, no matter their views on the climate, would think that's a reasonable way to go about it.

I am talking about the highest land altitude that a tsunami has ever reached much later after its crashing in coast.PS2: I understand that my question is not clear and it has vagueness, so I will try to clarify it. Every point in the surface of Earth has coordinates (with respect to North and East). And each unique point has an altitude. Two examples: a) The point with coordinates 27.9881° N, 86.9250° E has altitude 8848 meters. It is Everest's summit. b) The point with coordinates 36°34′N 21°8′E has altitude - 5267 m.

As I understand this can happen only by phenomena like big waves or tsunamis. There is no something else. So where is this point and what is its altitude? In that case, we don't care about the height or the momentum of the wave. Also the accuracy is not so important... Just an idea &quot;when a tsunami climbed a mountain&quot;.About Lituya Bay in Alaska... There is a mountain there: Fairweather with altitude 4671 m...

{"query": "Spacetime Torsion, the Spin tensor, and intrinsic spin in Einstein-Cartan theoryIn Einstein-Cartan gravity, the action is the usual Einstein-Hilbert action but now the Torsion tensor is allowed to vary as well (in usual GR, it is just set to zero).Variation with respect to the metric gives:$$R_{ab}-\\frac{1}{2}R g_{ab}=\\kappa P_{ab} \\quad (1)$$where $P_{ab}$ is the canonical stress energy tensor.

Likewise, we assume that the principal consumer of O2 is the oxidation of carbon (e.g. through respiration or combustion), in which the consumption of an O2 molecule requires the production of a CO2 molecule. Therefore, without an external source or sink of CO2, any increase in O2 requires an equivalent decrease in CO2, and vice versa.We know that O2 levels rose to ~30% of the total atmosphere during the Carboniferous era. Thus, O2 levels fell by 9% in the 350 million years that followed. This appears to require a concomitant increase in CO2 of 9%, by the assumptions above.

Fix $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, andlet $S_{n}$ be the symmetric group of the set $\\left\\{  1,2,\\ldots,n\\right\\}$.Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional $\\mathbb{K}$-vector space. The symmetric group$S_{n}$ acts on the $n$-th tensor power $V^{\\otimes n}$ by permuting the tensorands:$\\sigma\\left(  v_{1}\\otimes v_{2}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes v_{n}\\right)=v_{\\sigma^{-1}\\left(  1\\right)  }\\otimes v_{\\sigma^{-1}\\left(  2\\right)}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes v_{\\sigma^{-1}\\left(  n\\right)  }$ for all $\\sigma\\inS_{n}$ and $v_{1},v_{2},\\ldots,v_{n}\\in V$.Thus, the group ring $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]  $ acts on $V^{\\otimesn}$ as well (by linearity). This makes $V^{\\otimes n}$ into a $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]  $-module.On the other hand, the monoid $\\left(  \\operatorname*{End}V,\\cdot\\right)  $acts on $V^{\\otimes n}$ as follows:$M\\left(  v_{1}\\otimes v_{2}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes v_{n}\\right)  =Mv_{1}\\otimesMv_{2}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes Mv_{n}$ for all $M\\in\\operatorname*{End}V$ and$v_{1},v_{2},\\ldots,v_{n}\\in V$.Thus, the monoid ring $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  \\left(  \\operatorname*{End}V,\\cdot\\right)  \\right]  $ acts on $V^{\\otimes n}$ as well. This makes$V^{\\otimes n}$ into a $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  \\left(  \\operatorname*{End}V,\\cdot\\right)  \\right]  $-module.(Many authors tend to restrict this module to a $\\mathbb{K}\\left[\\operatorname*{GL}V\\right]  $-module, but this doesn't feel particularlynatural to me. Either way, these things behave pretty much interchangeably.)Schur-Weyl duality makes the following two claims:  (a) Each endomorphism of the $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]  $-module  $V^{\\otimes n}$ is the action of some element of $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  \\left(\\operatorname*{End}V,\\cdot\\right)  \\right]  $.    (b) Each endomorphism of the $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  \\left(\\operatorname*{End}V,\\cdot\\right)  \\right]  $-module $V^{\\otimes n}$ is the  action of some element of $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]  $.In general, \"some element\" is not uniquely determined, as none of the twomodule structures is faithful. The $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]  $-modulestructure is faithful when $n\\leq\\dim V$; the $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  \\left(\\operatorname*{End}V,\\cdot\\right)  \\right]  $-module structure is probablynever faithful. The quotients that do act faithfully can be described, butthis is a different story.How is this usually proven?For a theorem that appears in every other book on representation theory,Schur-Weyl duality seems to have a shortage of actually distinct proofs. Theargument (as given, e.g., in §4.18 and §4.19 of Pavel Etingof et al,Introduction to representation theory, arXiv:0901.0827v5) proceeds,roughly, as follows: [EDIT: The proof outlined in the following is neither the simplest nor the slickest version of the standard argument. The Etingof-et-al text does it in a much clearer way, by factoring out some of the semisimple-modules arguments into a general lemma. As pointed out by commenters, David Speyer and Mark Wildon (in MO question #90094) have further elementarized the argument, but their versions are still not as lightweight as I'd like them to be (e.g., they still use Schur's lemma, requiring proof of absolute irreducibility).]First prove part (a) using fairly elementary methods. (Outline: Let $f$be an endomorphism of the $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]  $-module$V^{\\otimes n}$. Write $f$ as a $\\mathbb{K}$-linear combination ofendomorphisms of the form $f_{1}\\otimes f_{2}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes f_{n}$,where each $f_{i}$ is in $\\operatorname*{End}V$. Since $f$ is $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]  $-equivariant, we can symmetrize it, so that $f$ alsobecomes a $\\mathbb{K}$-linear combination of endomorphisms of the form$\\dfrac{1}{n!}\\sum_{\\sigma\\in S_{n}}f_{\\sigma\\left(  1\\right)  }\\otimesf_{\\sigma\\left(  2\\right)  }\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes f_{\\sigma\\left(  n\\right)  }$, where each $f_{i}$ is in $\\operatorname*{End}V$. It remains to show thateach endomorphism of the latter form is the action of some element of$\\mathbb{K}\\left[  \\left(  \\operatorname*{End}V,\\cdot\\right)  \\right]  $. Thisis done using some polarization identity, e.g., $\\sum_{\\sigma\\in S_{n}}f_{\\sigma\\left(  1\\right)  }\\otimes f_{\\sigma\\left(  2\\right)  }\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes f_{\\sigma\\left(  n\\right)  }=\\sum_{I\\subseteq\\left\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\right\\}  }\\left(  -1\\right)  ^{n-\\left\\vert I\\right\\vert }\\left(\\sum_{i\\in I}f_{i}\\right)  ^{\\otimes n}$.)Let $B$ be the $\\mathbb{K}$-algebra $\\operatorname*{End}\\nolimits_{\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]  }\\left(  V^{\\otimes n}\\right)  $.Then, $B$ is a quotient of $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  \\left(  \\operatorname*{End}V,\\cdot\\right)  \\right]  $ because of part (a). Thus, $\\operatorname*{End}\\nolimits_{\\mathbb{K}\\left[  \\left(  \\operatorname*{End}V,\\cdot\\right)\\right]  }\\left(  V^{\\otimes n}\\right)  =\\operatorname*{End}\\nolimits_{B}\\left(  V^{\\otimes n}\\right)  $.Recall that $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]  $ is a semisimple algebra (byMaschke's theorem), and thus $V^{\\otimes n}$ decomposes as $V^{\\otimesn}=\\bigoplus_{\\lambda\\in\\Lambda}V_{\\lambda}\\otimes L_{\\lambda}$ for somefinite set $\\Lambda$, some nonzero $\\mathbb{K}$-vector spaces $V_{\\lambda}$and some pairwise non-isomorphic simple $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]$-modules $L_{\\lambda}$. Conclude that $\\operatorname*{End}\\nolimits_{\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]  }\\left(  V^{\\otimes n}\\right)\\cong\\prod_{\\lambda\\in\\Lambda}\\operatorname*{End}\\left(  V_{\\lambda}\\right)$. This is a particularly tricky step, since several things are happening atonce here: First of all, we need to know that $\\operatorname*{End}\\nolimits_{\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]  }\\left(  L_{\\lambda}\\right)\\cong\\mathbb{K}$, which would be a consequence of Schur's lemma if we assumedthat $\\mathbb{K}$ is algebraically closed, but as we don't, requires someknowledge of the representation theory of $S_{n}$ (namely, of the fact thatthe simple $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]  $-modules are the Specht modules,and are absolutely simple). But even knowing that, we need to know that theendomorphism ring of a direct sum of irreducible $\\mathbb{K}\\left[S_{n}\\right]  $-modules decomposes as a direct product according to theisotypic components, and on each component is a matrix ring. This is standardtheory of semisimple algebras, but also requires a nontrivial amount of work.Now, $B=\\operatorname*{End}\\nolimits_{\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]}\\left(  V^{\\otimes n}\\right)  \\cong\\prod_{\\lambda\\in\\Lambda}\\operatorname*{End}\\left(  V_{\\lambda}\\right)  $, so the $V_{\\lambda}$ for$\\lambda\\in\\Lambda$ are the simple $B$-modules. Hence, the decomposition$V^{\\otimes n}=\\bigoplus_{\\lambda\\in\\Lambda}V_{\\lambda}\\otimes L_{\\lambda}$can be viewed as a decomposition of the $B$-module $V^{\\otimes n}$ intosimples. Hence, the endomorphisms of the $B$-module $V^{\\otimes n}$ are directsums of the form $\\bigoplus_{\\lambda\\in\\Lambda}\\operatorname*{id}\\nolimits_{V_{\\lambda}}\\otimes f_{\\lambda}$, where each $f_{\\lambda}$ lies in$\\operatorname*{End}\\left(  L_{\\lambda}\\right)  $. (This, again, requires somebasic semisimple module theory.) It is now straightforward to show that allsuch isomorphisms are actions of elements of $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]$ (indeed, the $L_{\\lambda}$ are pairwise non-isomorphic simple $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]  $-modules, and thus $\\prod_{\\lambda\\in\\Lambda}\\operatorname*{End}\\left(  L_{\\lambda}\\right)  $ is a quotient of$\\mathbb{K}\\left[  S_{n}\\right]  $). Due to $\\operatorname*{End}\\nolimits_{\\mathbb{K}\\left[  \\left(  \\operatorname*{End}V,\\cdot\\right)\\right]  }\\left(  V^{\\otimes n}\\right)  =\\operatorname*{End}\\nolimits_{B}\\left(  V^{\\otimes n}\\right)  $, this yields part (b).What do I want?I am fairly happy with the proof of part (a) given above, but the proof ofpart (b) is exactly the kind of argument I shun. It is implicit,non-constructive and relies on half a semester's worth of representationtheory. Probably my biggest problem with it is aesthetical -- I see (b) asa combinatorial problem (at least a lot of its invariant-theoreticalapplications are combinatorial in nature), but the proof is combing this catcompletely against the grain (if not pulling it along its tail). But askingfor a combinatorial or explicit proof is not a well-defined problem, whereasasking for a constructive one, at least, is clear-cut.That said, I suspect that a constructive proof can be obtained by somestraightforward manipulations of the above argument. The representation theoryof $S_{n}$ can be done constructively (see, e.g., Adriano Garsia's notes onYoung's seminormal form), and most semisimple-algebra arguments canprobably be emulated by plain linear algebra (albeit losing what littleintuitive meaning they carry). I would much prefer something that avoids thisand either significantly simplifies the representation theory or replaces itby something completely different.What has been done?My hopes for a better proof have a reason: Schur-Weyl duality actually worksin far greater generality than the above proof. Theorem 1 in Steven Doty'sSchur-Weyl duality in positive characteristic that both (a) and (b) hold for any infinite field $\\mathbb{K}$,no matter what the characteristic is! The proof in that paper, however, goesway over my head (it isn't self-contained either, so the 17 pages are not anupper bound). Another paper that might contain answers is Roger W. Carter andGeorge Lusztig, On the Modular Representations of the General Linear andSymmetric Groups, but that one looks even less approachable.Of course, I would love to see a proof that works for any infinite field$\\mathbb{K}$, or maybe even more generally for any commutative ring$\\mathbb{K}$, assuming that we replace the endomorphisms of the $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  \\left(  \\operatorname*{End}V,\\cdot\\right)  \\right]  $-module$V^{\\otimes n}$ by a more reasonable notion of $\\operatorname*{GL}$-equivariant maps (namely, endomorphisms of $V^{\\otimes n}$ that commute withthe action of a \"generic $n\\times n$-matrix\" adjoined freely to the basering). But I would be happy enough to see just vanilla Schur-Weyl dualityproven in a neat way.One step that can be done easily is a proof of part (b) in the case when$\\dim V\\geq n$. Namely, in this case, we can argue as follows: Let $\\left(e_{1},e_{2},\\ldots,e_{d}\\right)  $ be the standard basis of $V$; thus, $d=\\dimV\\geq n$. Let $F$ be an endomorphism of the $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  \\left(\\operatorname*{End}V,\\cdot\\right)  \\right]  $-module $V^{\\otimes n}$. Let$\\eta=F\\left(  e_{1}\\otimes e_{2}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes e_{n}\\right)  $. Forevery $n$ vectors $v_{1},v_{2},\\ldots,v_{n}\\in V$, we can find a linear map$M\\in\\operatorname*{End}V$ satisfying $v_{i}=Me_{i}$ for all $i\\in\\left\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\right\\}  $, and thus we have$F\\left(  v_{1}\\otimes v_{2}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes v_{n}\\right)  =F\\left(Me_{1}\\otimes Me_{2}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes Me_{n}\\right)  $$=\\left(  M\\otimes M\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes M\\right)  \\underbrace{F\\left(e_{1}\\otimes e_{2}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes e_{n}\\right)  }_{=\\eta}$ (since $F$ is$\\mathbb{K}\\left[  \\left(  \\operatorname*{End}V,\\cdot\\right)  \\right]  $-equivariant)$=\\left(  M\\otimes M\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes M\\right)  \\eta$.Thus, the value of $\\eta$ uniquely determines the endomorphism $F$.Furthermore, we can write $\\eta$ as a $\\mathbb{K}$-linear combination of puretensors of the form $e_{i_{1}}\\otimes e_{i_{2}}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes e_{i_{n}}$and show that, for each such pure tensor that actually occurs in this linearcombination (with nonzero coefficient), the $n$-tuple $\\left(  i_{1},i_{2},\\ldots,i_{n}\\right)  $ must be a permutation of $\\left(  1,2,\\ldots,n\\right)  $. (To prove this, we assume the contrary; i.e., assume that the$n$-tuple $\\left(  i_{1},i_{2},\\ldots,i_{n}\\right)  $ is not a permutation of$\\left(  1,2,\\ldots,n\\right)  $, but the tensor $e_{i_{1}}\\otimes e_{i_{2}}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes e_{i_{n}}$ does occur in $\\eta$. Thus, either one of thenumbers $i_{1},i_{2},\\ldots,i_{n}$ is $&gt;n$, or two of these numbers are equal.In the first case, pick an $M\\in\\operatorname*{End}V$ that sends thecorresponding $e_{i_{k}}$ to $0$; in the second, pick an $M\\in\\operatorname*{End}V$ that multiplies the corresponding $e_{i_{k}}$ by ageneric $\\lambda$. Either way, again use the $\\mathbb{K}\\left[  \\left(\\operatorname*{End}V,\\cdot\\right)  \\right]  $-equivariance of $F$ to obtainsomething absurd. Sorry for the lack of details.) The result is that $\\eta$is a $\\mathbb{K}$-linear combination of various permutations of$e_1 \\otimes e_2 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes e_n$; and therefore, $F$ (beingdetermined by this $\\eta$) is the action of some element of$\\mathbb{K}\\left[S_n\\right]$.However, this argument completely breaks down when $\\dim V&lt;n$, since$e_{1}\\otimes e_{2}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes e_{n}$ does not exist any more. Isthere any way to fix it, or is it a dead end?(Remark: This argument for part (b) in the case $\\dim V \\geq n$ is quite similar to the proof of Theorem 3.6 in Tom Halverson, Arun Ram, Partition Algebras, which in itself is a kind of Schur-Weyl duality (but where the symmetric group acts on each tensorand instead of permuting the tensorands!).)A few more pointers:Maybe Weyl's unitary trick gives another proof of Schur-Weyl duality, but it would probably be neither constructive nor combinatorical in my book (Haar measure!).There are various papers on a combinatorial approach to invariant theory (e.g., D. Eisenbud, D. De Concini, C. Procesi, Young diagrams and determinantal varieties, which appears to be one of the most readable). However, it is not clear whether they give an answer. The invariant theory of the $\\operatorname{GL}$-action on tuples of vectors and covectors (by multiplication) is usually derived (in characteristic $0$, in the non-combinatorial approach) from Schur-Weyl duality; however, I don't know how one would go in the reverse direction (after all, the projection from the tensor algebra to the symmetric algebra is not injective). The FFT for the invariant theory of the $\\operatorname{GL}$-action on tuples of matrices by (simultaneous) conjugation is actually equivalent to Schur-Weyl duality, but I haven't seen anyone claim a combinatorial approach to that one.Schur's thesis Ueber eine Klasse von Matrizen, die sich einer gegebenen Matrix zuordnen lassen is available online from two places and but I am not sure if Schur-Weyl duality is actually in there. (Its notations are sufficiently dated that even searching for the statement is a nontrivial task.)The notion of \"Schur-Weyl duality\" is not standardized across literature; some authors use this name for different assertions. For example, Daniel Bump, in Chapter 34 of his Lie Groups (2nd edition), proves something he calls \"Frobenius-Schur duality\", and claims that this is exactly Schur-Weyl duality. But it is not what I call Schur-Weyl duality above; it is just the one-to-one correspondence between representations of symmetric groups and Schur functors.UPDATE: In comments to this post, Frieder Ladisch has alerted me to the fact that the double centralizer theorem (or, rather, the part of the double centralizer theorem that is relevant to the proof of part b)) can be proven constructively (provided that the input is sufficiently explicit). And now I am seeing that essentially his proof appears in Section 11.1 of Jan Draisma and Dion Gijswijt, Invariant Theory with Applications. (Jan: I took the freedom to guess the URL of the PDF file, seeing that the hyperlink was broken due to an incorrect relative path. If you actually don't want these notes to be linked, please let me know!) Some parts of their argument need to be slightly modified to ensure constructivity: The use of continuity in the proof of Theorem 11.1.1 should be replaced by a straightforward argument using Zariski density. The group $H$ in Theorem 11.1.2 should be required to be finite. The vector space $W$ in Theorem 11.1.2 should be required to be finite-dimensional. The requirement in Theorem 11.1.2 that the representation $\\lambda$ be completely reducible should be replaced by a requirement that $\\left|H\\right|$ is invertible in the ground field. The direct complement $U$ of $M$ in the proof of Theorem 11.1.2 should be constructed using Maschke's theorem, which has a well-known proof relying merely on linear algebra (viz., the existence of a complement of an explicitly-defined subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space).Of course, this beautiful argument still \"feels inexplicit\" in the sense that it uses some representation-theoretical ideas. But the worst offenders (Artin-Wedderburn theory, passing to algebraic closure, etc.) are gone. Had I known this argument in advance, I wouldn't have asked this question. Nevertheless, I am leaving this question open, since I have yet to digest various other answers, some of which appear to lead to more general proofs, maybe even in positive characteristic (for whatever parts of Schur-Weyl duality hold there).", "query_id": 446}

Again, this question formally has no need to be connected the theory of field with one element to make sense. Other than just mentioning the above, let us not get into that aspect.I am interested in other possible and promising methods. I am not interested in an equivalent formulation of Riemann hypothesis which is no better than the original. Both the above are very promising in terms of undiscovered things and might give a much better \"big picture\".An approach I am ambivalent about, is that of Baez-Duarte. Though it does provide some evidence. I do not know whether it is any easier to prove Riemann hypothesis that way, rather than the original statement.Please give me examples of any other methods; preferably very \"promising\" ones.Edit 1: The meaning of \"methods outside number theory\" is the following: Nothing in the book of Ivic or Titchmarsch and Heath-Brown. More precisely, methods outside the traditional sybjects of elementary number theory and analytic number theory. I have given two examples above.

According to the Reeh-Schlieder theorem there are correlations in the vacuum state between measurements at an arbitrary distance. The point is: The proof of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem is independent of any axiom describing causality, showing that quantum entanglement effects do not violate Einstein causality, and don't depend on the precise notion of causality. Therefore a change in spacetime topology in order to explain quantum entanglement effects won't work.which is also preceded with an appropriate note of caution, saying that the above paragraph:  ... describes an aspect of axiomatic quantum field theory which may become obsolete in the future with the development of a more complete theory.I had a bias against AQFT as being too abstract an obtuse branch of study to be of any practical use. However, in light of the possibility (recently discussed on physics.SE) that classical geometry arises due to the entanglement between the degrees of freedom of some quantum many-body system (see Swingle's paper on Entanglement Renormalization and Holography) the content of the Rees-Schilder theorem begins to seem quite profound and far-sighted.The question therefore is: Does the Rees-Schlieder theorem provide support for the idea of building space-time from quantum entanglement? or am I jumping the gun in presuming their is some connection between what the theorem says and the work of Vidal, Evenbly, Swingle and others on \"holographic entanglement\"?", "query_id": 470}

{"query": "The phrase &quot;Trace Anomaly&quot; seems to be used in two different ways. What&#39;s the relation between the two?I've seen the phrase \"Trace Anomaly\" refer to two seemingly different concepts, though I assume they must be related in some way I'm not seeing. The first way I've seen it used is in the manner, for example, that is relevant for the a-theorem and c-theorem.  That is, given a CFT on a curved background, the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is non-zero due to trace anomalies which relate $T^\\mu_\\mu$ to different curvatures, that is (in 4D) $T^\\mu_\\mu\\sim b\\square R+aE_4+cW^2$, where $E_4$ is the Euler density and $W^2$ is the square of the Weyl tensor.  The second manner in which I've seen it used is in the context of relating $T^\\mu_\\mu$ to beta functions as the presence of a non-zero beta function indicates scale dependence, and hence breaks conformal invariance.  For example, Yang-Mills is classically conformally invariant but it is quoted as having a trace anomaly which seems to be of different character than that of the previous paragraph.  As in the Peskin and Schroeder chapter on scale anomalies, it's quoted that since the gauge coupling, $g$, depends on scale due to RG the theory is not quantum mechanically scale invariant (or more generally, I guess, Weyl invariant) and hence $T^\\mu_\\mu$ is non-zero.  Slightly more precisely, given the YM lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}\\sim \\frac{1}{g^2}{\\rm Tr}F^2$, one finds $T^\\mu_\\mu\\sim \\beta(g){\\rm Tr}F^2$, or something to that effect.  It's my understanding that this second kind of trace anomaly is important for explaining the mass of nuclei, as most of their mass comes from gluonic energy.

{"query": "Implications of non-negativity of coefficients of arbitrary Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials?In their seminal 1979 paper Representations of Coxeter groups and Hecke algebras (Invent. Math. 53, and Lusztig studied an arbitrary Coxeter group $(W,S)$ and the corresponding Iwahori-Hecke algebra.   In particular they showed how to pass from a standard basis of this algebra to a more canonical basis, with the change of basis coefficients involving polynomials indexed by pairs of elements of $W$ (in the Bruhat ordering) over $\\mathbb{Z}$.   Even though the evidence at the time was quite limited, they conjectured following the statement of their Theorem 1.1 that the coefficients of these polynomials should always be non-negative.  (In very special cases this is true because the coefficients give dimensions of certain cohomology groups.)Several decades later, Wolfgang Soergel worked out a coherent strategy for proving the non-negativity conjecture, in his paperKazhdan–Lusztig-Polynome und unzerlegbare Bimoduln über Polynomringen. J. Inst. Math. Jussieu 6 (2007), no. 3, 501–525, that his program seems to have been completed, it is natural to renew the question in the header:What if any implications would the non-negativity of coefficients of arbitrary Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials have?It has to be emphasized that in Soergel's formulation and the following work, the non-negativity is not itself the main objective.   Instead the combinatorial framework proposed was meant to provide a more self-contained conceptual setting for proof of the original Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture on Verma module multipliities for a semisimple Lie algebra (soon a theorem) and further theorems in representation theory of a similar flavor.   But Coxeter groups form a vast general class of groups given by generators and relations, so it is surprising to encounter such strong constraints on the polynomials occurring in this generality.ADDED: There is some overlap with older questions related to Soergel's approach, posted here andhere.UPDATE: It's been pointed out to me that older work by Jim Carrell and Dale Peterson involves the non-negativity condition, though their main goal is the study of singularities of Schubert varieties in classical cases.   See the short account (with a long title)J.B. Carrell, The Bruhat graph of a Coxeter group, a conjecture of Deodhar, and rational smoothness of Schubert varieties.Algebraic groups and their generalizations: classical methods (University Park, PA, 1991), 53–61, Proc.

{"query": "Why aren&#39;t betavoltaics and alphavoltaics batteries widely used?Betavoltaic batteries are devices which creates electricity from beta radiation of a radioactive material. Alphavoltaics operate similarly, using alpha radiation. The concept was invented roughly 50 years ago and they are safe enough to be used, for example, in pacemakers.However, the Wikipedia article on them states that they were \"phased out as cheaper lithium-ion batteries were developed.\" I feel, though, that lithium ion batteries are hardly up to the task that consumers would want them to perform: for instance, iPhones hold their charge for about a day and notebooks can sometimes manage no more than four hours. Betavoltaics, on the other hand, can hold their charge for years.Why, then, are they not used in commercial applications? What are their relative advantages and disadvantages with respect to the current solutions, and in particular to lithium ion batteries?UPDATEAmount of electricity is tied with half-life. For example, if Ni-63 has half-life of 100 years this means, that mole of Nickel will produce electrons during that 100 years. This means 10^21 electrons per year and 10^14 electrons per second. This means up to 0.1 mA or electric current. The energy of electrons from Nickel is 67 keV. This means that each electron has 67 kilovolts of electric tension.So, the power of electricity from one mole of Nickel-63 is 67000*0.0001 = up to 6 watts.Other way to calculate. If Nickel-64 produces 10^14 electrons per second, each of 67 keV of energy, then the power is 7 * 10^4 * 10^14 = 7 * 10^4 * 10^14 * 10^(-19) = 0.7 Watts.So, the numbers are consistent to the order of magnitude.Approximating, one mole of Nickel-63 provides 1 watt of electricity approx.This looks sufficient for many cases including iPhone power consumption.1 mole of Nickel-63 weights 63 grams. iPhones accumulator can weight more than 100.So atomic batteries can supersede conventional batteries, and serve for years.So why we don't use them?", "query_id": 486}

{"query": "Demystifying time-reversal symmetry in physicsBriefly, which physical theories are expected to be time reversal invariant? That is, the mapping of $t\\to -t$ will not alter the physics.Even in Classical Mechanics (CM) it is not obvious if time reversal ought to leave things invariant:On the one hand the three laws of Newton seem to be time-agnostic. (e.g. in the second law, reversing the time leaves the accelaration unchanged).On the other hand we know in reality all systems are lossy, e.g. friction is unavoidable, this alone suffices to break any chance of time reversal invariance.This can be easily exemplified, if we take for example a damped oscillator, the Newton's equation of motion is no longer time symmetric, that is: $$m \\ddot{x}\\propto -\\dot{x}-kx \\neq m \\ddot{x}\\propto \\dot{x}-kx$$I guess the last latter point boils down to the second law of thermodynamics.In Quantum Mechanics (QM), from the Schrödinger's equation one can show that a simple mapping of $t \\to -t $ will not render the physics invariant, since an additional antilinear mapping of the wavefunction is required, in the sense that only if $\\Psi(t)\\to \\Psi^*(-t)$ is chosen, the equation remains the same.Questions:Am I going completely bonkers with any of the above observations?More importantly, what would it mean for a physical theory to be time reversal invariant?

I've seen plenty of works that assume that it does, but without discussing it; in particular there is this paper by Tsirelson that states (in the particular case of Bell inequalities) that both approaches are equivalent, but without proving it. Is it too obvious?At first sight, an ontological noncontextual theory is much more general than some theory embedded in a C*-algebraic framework.

{"query": "On Mathematical Analysis of MathSciNet &amp; MathOverflowThis question has two original motivations: mathematical and social. The mathematical motivation is mainly based on what I have seen about Zipf's law here and there. The Zipf's law simply states that a Zipfian distribution (a variant of power-law probability distribution) provides a good approximation of many types of data corresponding to physical or social phenomena. The iconic example is the frequency of the words used in a natural language where the Zipf's law indicates that the most frequent word in the language will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc. There are plenty of other surprising appearances of Zipf's (and power) law in various real-world situations. For instance, Silagadze in his paper, \"Citations and the Zipf-Mandelbrot's law\", shows that the number of citations in scientific papers obeys the Zipf's law!These made me think whether distributions appear, in other ways, in large mathematical research databases such as Arxiv, MathSciNet, or MathOverflow, say in the number of publications, co-authors, reviews, reputation points, etc.The social motivation, however, comes from occasional general claims by some mathematicians about how the mathematical society was, is or will be. Statements such as the followings: The mathematical paradigm is slowly shifting from pure mathematics to applied as more and more mathematicians are doing research of applied nature. In comparison with other branches of logic, model theory has the strongest ties with other mathematical disciplines. Due to the urgent need and rapid advancement in AI and computer science, computability and complexity are the most rapidly expanding branches of mathematical logic.  The most influential work of a mathematician usually happens before age 40. Such controversial claims often provoke intense arguments among the mathematicians. The question is how to settle them once for all. Indeed, a  rigorous approach towards verification of any such social claim is to mathematically analyze the large mathematical databases such as Arxiv, MathSciNet, or MathOverflow in order to extract general patterns including the distribution of research topics, possible changes in mathematical research fashion and evaluating the interaction and intersection of various mathematical disciplines with each other.   These motivations lead to the following general question:   Question. Have large mathematical databases such as Arxiv, MathSciNet, or MathOverflow been the subject of any social network and database analysis so far? What are examples of published mathematical research about possible mathematical patterns that may exist in them as databases? What patterns are found? (I am particularly interested in the case of Zipf's law and other naturally occurring statistical patterns such as Benford's law.)   It is likely that some journal ranking organizations have already conducted some research along these lines but I haven't seen any outline so far. It is also interesting if the research has been done in a comparative way which allows one to compare the general characteristics of math community with its other counterparts, say physics or biology. Update. A MathOverflow fellow just emailed me expressing his interest in conducting some statistical research on MathSciNet and MathOverflow databases. He asked whether I know how to get access to the corresponding background data, which I actually don't. I am not even sure if it is publicly accessible or free (particularly in the case of MathSciNet and Arxiv). I also suspect that there must be some non-disclosure rules and restrictions which any corresponding research along these lines should follow.

Also, this method of travel does not actually involve moving faster than light in a local sense, since a light beam within the bubble would still always move faster than the ship; it is only \"faster than light\" in the sense that, thanks to the contraction of the space in front of it, the ship could reach its destination faster than a light beam restricted to travelling outside the warp bubble.I'm confused about the statement \"conventional relativistic effects such as time dilation do not apply\".Say Bob lives on Earth, and Jill lives on a planet in Andromeda, and we'll say for the sake of argument that they're stationary.

{"query": "Why does the Heisenberg uncertainty principle apply to particles?This might be a slightly naive question, and if so I apologize, but I am currently a little confused as to why the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle should apply to particles, i.e. our system (say an electron) after we observe it and collapse it’s wave function.From what I understand, the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle just comes from the fact that momentum is the Fourier transform of position (wave number technically I think, but all the same since momentum is related to wavelength which is related to wave number). The more localized one is, the less localized the other will be because ‘localized’ things require a larger distribution of frequencies to localize them.Nonetheless, it seems as those this should only hold, if our object is treated as a wave, but if we treat it like a particle, it feels like this should just go away. Even if you represent a particle like a wave by using something like the Dirac delta function or whatnot, you would get essentially an infinite number of corresponding wave numbers, in other words total uncertainty on the momentum which seem strange if we think of things like particles classically. It just feels like in order for Heisenberg to hold, things always need to be ‘wave-like’ in some sense.

Specifically, if  $X_1\\xrightarrow{\\varphi}X$ for a scheme $X$, s.t. $\\mathcal{S}\\left(\\varphi\\right)\\in Isom$ for $\\mathcal{S}(-)$ is the sheaffication functor, then for all affine covers $U_i\\xrightarrow{u_i}X$ there exists a refinement $V_{ij}\\xrightarrow{u_{ij}}U_i$ which factors through $\\varphi$.This hinges on the fact that $V_{ij}$ is representable and thus projective, a result of the fact that we are working with presheaves. In sheaves, we would lose these refinements. Additionally, these presheaves do not depend on the specific topology(at the cost of gluing).In this setting, we lose projectives because we are applying the localization functor which is not exact(only right exact). However, I don't really understand this reason, and would like a more general answer. A related appearance of this loss is in homological algebra. Sheaves do not have enough projectives, so we cannot always get projective resolutions. They do have injective resolutions, and this is related to the use of cohomology of sheaves rather than homology of sheaves. In paticular, in Rotman's Homological Algebra pg 314, he gives a footnote;  In The Theory of Sheaves, Swan writes \"...if the base space X is not discrete, I know   of no examples of projective sheaves except the zero sheaf.\" In Bredon, Sheaf Theory:   on locally connected Hausdorff spaces without isolated points, the only   projective sheaf is 0addressing this situation.

So provability is stronger than consistency.  This might lead one to think that constructing a consistency proof for a statement should be strictly easier than constructing a proof.Yet consistency proofs (at least oft-cited ones, for example those by Godel and Cohen about the Continuum Hypothesis) seem to require a high level of sophistication (though this might be a byproduct of the fact that consistency proofs like these are for the special class of statements that cannot be proven).For statements that can be proven then, are there cases where their consistency proofs are easier or came before the proofs themselves?Update:Thanks a lot, everyone, for the great answers so far.

Indeed $H^2_\\mathrm{b}(\\Gamma,\\mathbf{R})=0$ (vanishing of bounded cohomology: Theorem 1.4 of Monod-Shalom 2004). So either (a) in the above central extension, $Z$ is distorted (in contrast to central extensions coming from connected coverings of ambient Lie groups), or (b) $Z$ is undistorted, and this would be a central extension by $Z$ that not represented by a bounded cohomology class. I'm not sure this is known to exist.  edit]In principle my question should be computer-answerable, if in a single case, one can implement a triangulation of the locally symmetric space, of reasonable size.Additional contextual notes: as far as I understand, the vanishing results (Matsushima, Zuckerman, Borel-Wallach...) for $b_2$ apply when $G$ is replaced by a simple Lie group of real rank $\\ge 3$, hence don't apply here.by Abert-Bergeron-Biringer-Gelander-Nikolov-Raimbault-Samet (Annals of Math 2017), we have, in $G$ arbitrary simple Lie group of rank $2$ and finite center, and $\\Gamma_n$ strictly decreasing sequence of cocompact lattices, $b_2(\\Gamma_n)=o([\\Gamma:\\Gamma_n])$.for non-cocompact lattices in $G=\\mathrm{SL}_3(\\mathbf{R})$, the picture is a bit different since the (rational) cohomological dimension is 3 or 4 (rather than 5) and there is no Poincaré duality. For instance, for a finite index subgroup of $\\mathrm{SL}_3(\\mathbf{Z})$, the rational cohomological dimension is 3, the Euler characteristic is 0, and hence we have $(b_0,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4,b_5)=(1,0,b_2,1+b_2,0,0)$. We can indeed (typically) have $b_2&gt;0$: it is proved by Ash (Bull AMS, 1977), for $\\Gamma=\\mathrm{Ker}(\\mathrm{SL}_3(\\mathbf{Z})\\to that $b_2\\ge 5814$. Is this evidence that cocompact lattices should also have nonzero $b_2$, I don't know.", "query_id": 513}
{"query": "Is the electromagnetic mass real?In his Lectures on Physics vol II Ch.28-2 Feynman calculates the field momentum of a moving charged sphere with charge $q$, radius $a$ and velocity $\\mathbf{v}$.

{"query": "Why was Einstein wrong about black holes?In 1939, Albert Einstein published a paper entitled &quot;On a Stationary System with Spherical Symmetry Consisting of Many Gravitating Masses.&quot;  In it, he considers the problem of whether it is possible to reach a spacetime metric containing singularities in a real physical system – that is, starting from actual gravitating masses.Consider a system of many small objects, with equal masses, which move under the influence of the gravitational field of the entire system.  Furthermore suppose that the particles move in concentric, randomly oriented circular orbits, so that the overall gravitational field is approximately static and spherically symmetric.  Then the spacetime metric is$$ds^2 = -a(r)(dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2) + b(r)\\, dt^2 ~$$where $a(r)$ and $b(r)$ are functions of the radius $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$.  By substituting this into the Einstein field equation$$G_{\\mu\\nu} = R_{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac12 g_{\\mu\\nu}R + \\kappa T_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$$one can obtain differential equations for $a(r)$ and $b(r)$:$$\\alpha'' + \\frac{\\alpha'}{r} + \\frac14 \\alpha'^2 - \\frac1{r^2} + \\kappa mn \\left( \\frac{\\alpha'^2}{\\frac32 \\alpha'^2 - \\frac2{r^2}} = 0$$$$\\beta' = \\frac1{\\alpha'} \\left( \\frac2{r^2} - \\frac12 \\alpha'^2 \\right)$$where $\\alpha = \\ln (r^2 a)$; $\\beta = \\ln b$; $m$ is the mass of each particle; and $n$ is the particle density.At first glance, these equations do not look very tractable.  However, the idealized limiting case where the gravitating particles are concentrated within an infinitesimally thin spherical shell of radius $r_0 \\pm \\Delta$ is relatively simple.  Einstein solves this case and shows that:$$r_0 &gt; \\frac\\mu2 (2 + \\sqrt3)$$where = \\frac12 \\left( \\frac{\\kappa}{8\\pi} mN \\right)$ is the Schwarzschild radius, with $mN$ being the total mass of the system.Since this lower bound is above the Schwarzschild radius, Einstein reasons, a system of masses in circular orbits cannot form a black hole.  He also generalizes this result to the case of continuous particle density and obtains a similar lower bound.  Physically, as $r_0$ decreases towards the bound (that is, as the system of masses becomes smaller and smaller), the kinetic energy of the system goes to infinity.  Intuitively, one would expect that the same reasoning should apply to other systems as well, though the fully general case is not addressed rigorously in the paper.Einstein concludes:The essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the &quot;Schwarzschild singularities&quot; do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters whose particles move along circular paths, it does not seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results.  The &quot;Schwarzschild singularity&quot; does not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light.Today, we know that black holes exist; hence, the argument above must be wrong.  But where was Einstein's mistake?  Was it the assumption of stable circular orbits?I saw this question: Einstein and the existence of Black Holes  However, the question does not discuss the actual argument made by Einstein himself, and the currently accepted answer simply states that Einstein's arguments are no more than heuristics and intuition.", "query_id": 517}

My question is what were the developments during the last decade, and what remaining issues prevent including such effective quantum gravity into the Standard Model on the same terms as say QCD?Of course, gravity is non-renormalizable, but after Weinberg renormalizability is considered a mathematical convenience rather than a must, it is nice to have, but...  In both renormalizable and non-renormalizable theories it is the cutoff that removes the divergencies and blocks high energy degrees of freedom, whose \"true\" theory is unknown. Burgess writes that \"non-renormalizable theories are not fundamentally different from renormalizable ones. They simply differ in their sensitivity to more microscopic scales which have been integrated out\". One problem with the older semi-classical gravity was that when one couples quantum fields to the classical metric tensor of general relativity it becomes possible to track quantum observables through changes in the tensor, so the uncertainty principle is violated. Conservation laws are also violated, see e.g. Rickles (p.20). Does effective quantum gravity avoid these problems? Burgess also mentions that even the leading quantum corrections might be too small to detect. Is it still the case, and is that where the main problem is?EDIT: Low Energy Theorems of Quantum Gravity from Effective Field Theory (2015) by Donoghue and Holstein seems to be relevant, it draws direct analogy to  QCD:\"In QCD at the lowest energies there exist only light pions which are dynamically active and the interactions of these pions are constrained by the original chiral symmetery of QCD.

Nuclear power increases the input because it's energy that would not be released here without us. But the question to ask is what's the significance of the energy input from nuclear power. Say for example that future society becomes fully powered on fusion reactors, the energy input from these reactors would be roughly $10^{22}$ (approx 20 times 2013 world energy consumption). We can compare to the total energy input from the sun, which is $10^{25}$ From these numbers, the input from nuclear would be about 0.1% the total solar input.

It is not necessary to know what the Dehn function of a group is (it is an important asymptotic invariant of a group). In this paper, we showed that if $\\alpha\\ge 4$ belongs to the isoperimetric spectrum if $\\alpha$ can be computed by a non-deterministic Turing machine in time at most $2^{c2^m}$ for some $c&gt;0$. Recently Olshanskii proved the same statement for all $\\alpha\\ge 2$ (the paper will appear in the Journal of Combinatorial Algebra).

Surprisingly, however, these two sets (despite looking much the same) turn out to be inequivalent: as far as the lattice translations know, the three $K$ points are exactly the same, but there's nothing in the lattice translation symmetry that relates them to the $K'$ points.Even more interestingly, these two Dirac points are generally referred to as having a specific chirality (as an example, see Phys.

{"query": "What is the experimental evidence for a quantized EM field?I've recently been trying to understand on a deeper level what is the physical meaning or existance of photons, and relatedly,  what is the experimental verification of their existance. We all learn that historically Einstein employed them to explain the photoelectric effect, after Planck discovered the quantization of energy allows correct derivation of blackbody radiation. Later, Compton's scattering experiments were also explained successfully using the photon picture and thus it became established that EM waves somehow propagate in quanta. A few years later Dirac correctly quantized the EM field, and the resulting theory explained the quantum nature of the EM field and light propagation, explaining the photon as the minimum excitation of the EM field, and QED began. (Correct me if this is false; I'm an undergrad and still don't have a formal knowledge in QFT.)The resulting theory also predicted verified phenomena such as the Lamb shift and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. However, it seems that in the years since then, many of the phenomena whose existence supposedly proves QED were derived from semiclassical models. According to Scully &amp; Zubairy in &quot;Quantum Optics&quot;,&quot;There are many processes associated with the radiation-matter interaction which can be well explained by a semiclassical theory in which the field is treated classically and the matter is treated quantum-mechanically. Examples of physical phenomena which can be explained either totally or largely by semiclassical theory include  the photoelectric effect, stimulated emission, resonance flourescence.Perhaps the most important example of a situation which is not covered by the semiclassical theory is the spontaneous emission of light. Furthermore, the Lamb shift is a good example of a physical situation which is only understood with the introduction of the vacuum into the problem... When vacuum fluctuations are included, we see that the Lamb shift is qualitatively accounted for and conceptually understood. Other phenomena, such as the Planck distribution  of blackbody radiation and the linewidth of the laser, can be understood by such smiclassical plus vacuum fluctuations arguments.&quot;Indeed as they mention, a google search shows derivations of the photoelctric effect, the compton effect, blackbody radiation, spontaneous emission, the Lamb shift, and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron - all the classical experimental verifications for the quantization of the EM field and QED (as far as I'm aware), from semiclassical models with vacuum fluctuations.Scully &amp; Zubairy do go on to describe a phenomenon in which the predictions of QED and semiclassical theory differ significantly: quantum beats in $\\Lambda$-type systems. In QED such systems show no quantum beats, while semiclassical theory predicts existance of beats in these systems. However, Scully &amp; Zubairy don't mention even a single experimental verification that indeed there are no beats in $\\Lambda$ systems, and I wasn't able to find any in google, either.And so I have to ask, what is, after all, the experimental verification that indeed the EM field is also quantized (and for the existance of photons). Were there experiments trying to detect the aforementioned quantum beats? Is there another effect or phenomenon whose predictions differ between QED and semiclassical theory (with vacuum fluctuations) and was shown experimentally to follow QED behavior, and thus the EM field is definitely quantized (I found the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect which might fit here, but I don't have enough knowledge to understand whether is really shows quantization of the field)? What are the experimental verifications for the existance of photons, which cannot be explained with semiclassical theory (in which there are no photons)? Are there, perhaps, theoretical or thought-experimental arguments for this quantization, if there's no definite experimental evidence? Even though QED is a well-established and well-tested theory, I feel like this is an important question to ask, because if we don't even have clear evidence that the EM field is definitely quantized, then who is to say gravity has to be quantized...", "query_id": 546}

{"query": "What was Casimir&#39;s precise role in describing the center of the universal enveloping algebra of a semisimple Lie algebra?  This question is prompted by a recent MO question on explicit computations of Weyl group invariants for certain exceptional simple Lie algebras:37602.   Like some others who started graduate study in the 1960s with almost no physics background but with an interest in abstract mathematics, I was  drawn to algebraic Lie theory for mainly esthetic reasons.   I also had no background in differential geometry or Lie groups.  So when I bought a copy of Jacobson's newly-published book on Lie algebras at a bookstore in Ithaca I had no appreciation of the historical connections of the subject. The eminent Dutch physicist H.B.G. Casimir was apparently the first to introduce an explicit second degree invariant (unique up to scalars) in the center of $U(\\mathfrak{g})$, now called the Casimir element or Casimir invariant.Roughly speaking, this involves fixing a basis of $\\mathfrak{g}$ along with its dual basis under the Killing form, then adding the respective products.  Sometimes it is convenient to recast the answer in terms of PBW monomials for the given ordered basis.    On the mathematical side, Chevalley and Harish-Chandra determined the full center of $U(\\mathfrak{g})$: it is a polynomial algebra in $\\ell$(= rank of $\\mathfrak{g}$) variables.   Generators can be taken to be homogeneous of uniquely determined degrees.   Moreover, the center is isomorphic in a natural way (but requiring a subtle $\\rho$-twist) to the algebra $U(\\mathfrak{h})^W$ of invariants of the Weyl group relative to a fixed Cartan subalgebra $\\mathfrak{h}$ of $\\mathfrak{g}$.   The earlier MO question involved this algebra and its (non-unique) homogeneous generators of degrees $2 = d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_\\ell$.   Key papers were those by Harish-Chandra (Trans. AMS 1951) and Chevalley (Amer. J. Math. 1955), the latter generalizing the fundamental theorem on elementary symmetric polynomials for $W=S_n$.      My question then is:   What role did Casimir's work play in this mathematical development?    A related matter is the practice of referring to homogeneous generators of the center of the enveloping algebra as \"Casimir operators\": how far was Casimir himself involved in this direction beyond his degree 2 invariant?ADDED: The short article referenced by mathphysicist is illuminating and may be thebest published indication of Casimir's influence on subsequent representation theory.   I was at first hoping to find a more definite paper trail, but this may not exist and would probably reach back before Math Reviews.   What struck me most in browsing through the first volume of Harish-Chandra's collected papers (1944-54) was the abrupt transition around 1948 from his work in physics like Motion of an electron to mathematics like Faithful representations of Lie algebras and of course his foundational 1951 paper I mentioned.   Nowhere along the way do I see any direct citation of Casimir's papers, though the 1950  paper Lie algebras and the Tannaka duality theorem does quote the \"Casimir operator\" in rank 1 as well known and uses it as a stepping-stone to the general case.   Since Harish-Chandra studied physics with Dirac in his early years, it was probably he who imported Casimir's idea into representation theory.  But Chevalley was at the time also a major influence on Harish-Chandra's thinking, so it's all hard to document.  (They both taught at Columbia for some time.)", "query_id": 552}

However, if I write $\\vert \\Psi \\rangle$ as an integral over infinitely-many \"position basis vectors\" $$\\vert \\Psi \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\Psi_x(x)\\vert x \\rangle$$then the position basis vectors $\\mid x \\rangle$ are Dirac delta functions - they aren't really functions.  If we try to represent them in the momentum basis, we get non-normalizable plane waves.  These basis vectors are not members of the physical Hilbert space.My undergraduate quantum text explains that the Dirac deltas and plane waves are calculational tools and demonstrates their use.  The Dirac deltas do not represent true wavefunctions.  A real particle with low position uncertainty would simply have a wavefunction with a high but finite peak.I'm fine with this; I think I understand how to do the calculations and what they mean.  However, I am still unsure of how to find a basis for the physical Hilbert space that consists of vectors actually in the space.In a bound state with no degeneracy, the energy eigenfunctions form a basis.  The physical Hilbert space then consists of all linear combinations of the energy eigenfunctions.  However, when we move to a scattering state, the spectrum of energy eigenvalues becomes continuous and the energy eigenfunctions are not normalizable because they are essentially the same as the plane-wave momentum eigenfunctions.Because the scattering state has a physical Hilbert space of  normalizable wavefunctions, shouldn't I be able to find a basis that consists of elements of the physical Hilbert space itself, even if this basis is not convenient for calculations?

{"query": "Why is Asperger Syndrome poorly recognised in France?Asperger Syndrome is quite well-known in psychiatric circles, as well as (to a lesser degree) the general public, in many countries the western world. However, in France, Asperger Syndrome is virtually unknown to the general public. From what I have read in various sources, French psychiatry denies the existence of Asperger Syndrome, instead using alternative diagnoses and alternative treatments, some of which can be very harmful. This is not the case in other Francophone areas; the situation in Belgium, Quebec and Switzerland is better.Below I quote the French Wikipedia article on Asperger Syndrome and I attempt to provide a translation:Le syndrome eut du mal à être reconnu et ne l'est pas encore totalement. Il peut être ignoré par les professionnels, parfois réticents à annoncer le diagnostic à cause d'orientations théoriques personnelles ; le syndrome d'Asperger n'existe pas en tant qu'entité distincte dans les précédentes versions de la CFTMEA et n'y a été individualisé que dans la dernière version (année 2000). Notons que les termes « disharmonie de développement », « disharmonie d'évolution », « disharmonie évolutive », « disharmonie psychotique », « Trouble Complexe et Multiple du Développement (MCDD Multiple-complex Developpemental Disorder) » sont souvent utilisés en France pour décrire les troubles autistiques. Ces termes ne figurent pas dans la nomenclature internationale CIM1014 et ne devraient plus être utilisés, selon les recommandations. De fait, depuis quelques années, certaines associations dénoncent des diagnostics de « dépression infantile » qui sont de plus en plus souvent prononcés à tort, en lieu et place des anciennes « disharmonies »15[réf. insuffisante].L'approche française se défait néanmoins progressivement d'une imprégnation psychanalytique qui propose une prise en charge singulière du diagnostic et de la prise en charge de ce syndrome.My rough translation attempt (a native speaker is encouraged to improve):The syndrome was difficult to be recognized and is still not fully. It can be ignored by professionals who may be reluctant to perform an Asperger diagnosis diagnosis because of personal theoretical opinions; Asperger syndrome does not exist as a separate entity in previous versions of the CFTMEA and was taken up as a separate entity only in the latest version (2000). Note that the terms &quot;disharmonic development,&quot; &quot;disharmony of evolution&quot;, &quot;progressive disharmony&quot;, &quot;psychotic disharmony&quot;, &quot;Disorder and Multiple Complex Development (TSLS Multiple-complex Developmental Disorder)&quot; are often used in France to describe autistic disorder. These terms are not included in the international nomenclature CIM1014 and should not be used as recommended. In fact, in recent years, some associations decry diagnostics of &quot;childhood depression&quot; that is increasingly often given erroneously, instead of the former &quot;disharmony&quot;.The French approach however defeats slowly a psychoanalytic penetration that proposes to take a unique diagnosis approach to take care of the syndrome.Why is Asperger Syndrome so poorly recognised in France?

{"query": "Does $S_4$ inject into $SL(2,R)$ for some commutative ring $R$?$\\newcommand{\\Z}{\\mathbf{Z}}$Given a nice infinite collection of groups, for example the symmetric groups, one can ask whether any finite group is a subgroup of one of them. Of course any finite group acts on itself, so any finite group is a subgroup of a symmetric group. Similarly any finite group acts linearly on its group ring over a finite field, so given a field $k$, any finite group embeds into $GL(n,k)$ for some sufficiently large $n$ (as permutation matrices).Question 1: What if we do what I ask in the title, and consider the groups $SL(2,R)$ as $R$ ranges over all commutative rings. Given an arbitrary finite group, can I find a commutative ring $R$ (with a 1) such that this group is a subgroup of $SL(2,R)$?Of course this is inspired by this pesky question which, at the time of typing, seems to remain unsolved.Here is a more specific question:Question 2: Is there a commutative ring $R$ (with a 1) such that the symmetric group $S_4$ injects into $SL(2,R)$?I haven't thought much about question 1 at all. I'll tell you what I know about question 2. Let's consider first the case where $R$ is an algebraically closed field. If the characteristic is zero, or greater than 3, then by character theory any map from $S_4$ into $SL(2,R)$ must contain $A_4$ in its kernel (the map must give a semisimple representation and the irreducible 2-dimensional one has non-trivial determinant).If the characteristic is 3 then considering the restriction of a map $S_4\\to SL(2,R)$ to a Sylow 2-subgroup we see again by character theory that the kernel must contain the central element. But the kernel is a normal subgroup of $S_4$ so it must contain $V_4$ and hence factors through a map $S_3\\to SL(2,R)$. Now the image of an element of order 2 must be central and it's not hard to deduce that the 3-cycles must again be in the kernel.In characteristic 2 there are more possibilities. If I got it right, the kernel of a map $S_4\\to SL(2,R)$ ($R$ alg closed char 2) is either $S_4$, $A_4$ or $V_4$ and of course the representation can be non-semisimple this time.We conclude from this case-by-case analysis that if $R$ is any ring and $S_4\\to SL(2,R)$ is any map then the image of $V_4$ is in $1+M_2(J)$, where $J$ is the intersection of all the prime ideals, that is, the nilpotent elements of $R$.I now wanted to consider the case $J^2=0$ and check that $V_4$ must be killed mod $J^2$ and then go by induction, but I couldn't bash it out and wonder whether it's true. It's clear that one could brute-force the argument if one could do a Groebner basis calculation over the integers. I have tried one of these in my life---when trying to solve the open problem of whether every finite flat group scheme of order 4 was killed by 4. That latter question seems to be beyond current computers, but perhaps the one I'm raising here might not be. The problem would be that one has to work over $\\Z$ and this slows things down greatly.I then looked for counterexamples, but convinced myself that $S_4$ was not a subgroup of either or with $\\epsilon^2=0$ [edit: I am wrong; does work, as pointed out by Tim Dokchitser].

While these are perhaps fanciful concepts, I think that it can be interesting to try to reconcile them in terms of current knowledge.  A modern author (Knox 2001) makes the following assessment:  I suggest that although, like Freud, Jung contradicted himself at times, there is a lot of evidence that he viewed archetypes as innate predispositions with an organizing function.  I think it is one of the possible models for archetypes that we need to research extensively by investigating the ways in which an understanding of 'frames' and image schemas may advance our concept.  We need to gain a clearer understanding of the extent to which archetypes are 'hard-wired', genetically inherited structures or, on the other hand, self-organizing patterns that emerge as a central part of the development of meaning by the human brain as...recently proposed.I think the arguments about genetically driven versus self-organizing patterns are fascinating, but in this question, I'd like to presuppose the latter.

{"query": "Even XOR Odd Infinities?Modular Arithmetic (MA) has the same axioms as first order Peano Arithmetic (PA) except $\\forall x (Sx \\ne 0)$ is replaced with $\\exists x(Sx = 0)$. has arbitrarily large finite models based on modular arithmetic. All finite models of MA have either an even or odd number of elements. I call a model of MA \"even\" if it satisfies both of these two sentences:E1) $\\exists x(x \\ne 0 \\land x+x = 0)$E2) $\\forall x(x+x \\ne S0)$A model of MA is odd if it satisfies both of:O1) $\\forall x(x = 0 \\lor x+x \\ne 0)$O2) $\\exists x(x+x = S0)$We can use compactness to prove MA has infinite \"even\" size models by adding the even definitions above as axioms. We can similarly prove there are infinite \"odd\" size models of MA. Some infinite sets, like the integers, are neither even nor odd. The integers are not the basis for a model of MA. For example, the four square theorem (every number is the sum of four squares) is a theorem of both MA and PA. The four square theorem is false in the integers. It has been conjectured the complex numbers are a basis for a model of MA. If so, the complex numbers would be an \"odd\" model of MA.My question is whether every model of MA must be exclusively even or exclusively odd? Is this statement a theorem of MA?$$\\exists x(x \\ne 0 \\land x+x = 0) \\ \\overline{\\vee}\\  \\exists x(x+x = S0)$$I asked this question on stack exchange and got no following was merged from an answer - ed.]Ashutosh's proof can be written as:$\\exists x\\exists y( (x+x=0 \\land y+y=1) \\implies (x=0) )$This answers my question when $\\exists x(x+x=1)$ is true but it says nothing about when $\\forall x(x+x \\ne 1)$ is true.  Emil and others have stated any algebraically closed field is a model of MA. Ashutosh's proof shows any algebraically closed field is odd because $\\exists x(x+x=1)$ is true.I want to accept Ben Crowell answer, but I have some reservations. The proof starts by showing how any model of MA can be expanded into a model of PA. I have made similar arguments and always assumed it would be easy to prove. My conjecture is true of all finite models of MA so we only need consider infinite models. MA is omega inconsistent and any infinite model must have non-standard elements. Tennebaum's theorem says addition is not recursive in non-standard models of PA. Can addition actually be recursive in $A$, the model of PA he constructs? It looks like he is assuming we can add non-standard numbers from the model of MA. I also wonder if he is assuming $I$ is a standard model of PA. I don't think it makes any difference, but it might.Obo's proof is much simpler and similar to a proof I came up with. My proof had the same error as his. I think it is fixable. In the case where we have $S(y+y)=p$ we need to also prove $y \\ne p$.  $y \\ne p$ can be true only in models with three or more elements.   This isn't a discussion group so I won't go into detail why I don't think the complex numbers are a model of MA. I don't think MA has any infinite models. I will point out MA proves a lot of interesting things about odd models. In an odd model the sum of all elements is 0. This can't be stated in first order. I think if we have a successor function defined on the complex numbers we can use it to order the reals. Just ignore numbers with a non-zero imaginary component.I want to retract my statement that the Lagrange's four square theorem is a theorem of MA. I based my claim on Andrew Boucher's paper on General Arithmetic (GA). Boucher shows GA proves the four square theorem. I thought GA was a weak sub-theory of MA because GA has much weaker successor axioms. Rereading the paper I see Boucher says he is using 2nd order induction. He also says successor is second order.", "query_id": 571}

These are only truly discontinuous in the $N \\to \\infty$ limit, which doesn't physically exist. For large but finite $N$, we can use statistical mechanics to get a perfectly continuous answer.Measurement in quantum mechanics. 'Copenhagen collapse' is not instantaneous, it's the result of interaction with an external system, which occurs in continuous time.Optical decays. Without QED, the best model is to just have atoms suddenly and randomly emit photons with some lifetime. With QED, we have a perfectly continuous time evolution (allowing for, e.g. Rabi oscillations).At this point I'm having trouble thinking of any 'real' discontinuities. Are there any theories (that we believe to be fundamental) that predict a discontinuity in a physically observable quantity?To address several comments: I am not looking for a discontinuity in time, as this is associated with infinite energy. I am not looking for experimental confirmation of a discontinuity in time, since that's impossible.

I'm using a Raspberry Pi as the onboard computer; and I'm using various plug-ins, such as a Raspberry Pi camera and distance sensors, for feedback on the car's surroundings. I'm using OpenCV to turn the video frames into tensors, and I'm using Google's TensorFlow to build a convoluted neural network to learn road boundaries and obstacles. My main question is, should I use supervised learning to teach the car to drive or should I provide objectives and penalties and do reinforcement learning (i.e, get to point B as fast as possible while not hitting anything and staying within the road boundaries)? Below is a list of the pros and cons that I've come up with.Supervised learning pros:The inputs to the learning algorithm are pretty straightforward. The car learns to associate the video frame tensor and sensor distance readings with forward, backward, and angular wheel displacementI can more or less teach the car to drive exactly how I want (without overfitting, of course)I've done tons of supervised learning problems before, and this approach seems to comfortably fit my existing skill setSupervised learning cons:It's not clear how to teach speed, and the correct speed is pretty arbitrary as long as the car doesn't go so fast that it veers off the road. I suppose I could drive fast during training, but this seems like a crude approach. Maybe I could manually add in a constant variable during training that corresponds to the speed for that training session, and then when the learning algorithm is deployed, I set this variable according to the speed I want? Reinforcement learning pros:If I build my car with the specific purpose of racing other people's self driving cars, reinforcement learning seems to be the natural way to tell my car to \"get there as fast as possible\" I've read that RL is sometimes used for autonomous drones, so in theory it should be easier in cars because I don't have to worry about up and downReinforcement learning cons:I feel like reinforcement learning would require a lot of additional sensors, and frankly my foot-long car doesn't have that much space inside considering that it also needs to fit a battery, the Raspberry Pi, and a breadboardThe car will behave very erratically at first, so much so that maybe it destroys itself. It might also take an unreasonably long time to learn (e.g., months or years)I can't incoporate explicit rules later on, e.g., stop at a toy red-light. With supervised learning, I could incorporate numerous SL algorithms (e.g., a Haar Cascade classifier for identifying stoplights) into a configurable rules engine that gets evaluated between each video frame. The rules engine would thus be able to override the driving SL algorithm if it saw a red stoplight even though the stoplight might not have been part of the training of the driving algorithm.

One student starts thinking though:The teacher can't wait until the last day of school, because then the exam won't be unexpected. So it can't be the last day.Since we've removed the last day from the list of possible days, the same logic applies to the day before the last day.By applying 1) and 2) we remove all the days from the list of possible days.So, it turns out that the teacher can't give a surprise exam at all.Following this logic, our student doesn't prepare for this test and is promptly flunked when the teacher does give it somewhere during the middle of the year (but that's my own creative addition to the problem).This problem reminds me about the prisoner's dilemma for finite number of turns - you have to betray at the last turn because tit-for-tat retaliation is no longer relevant (no next turn), but then that means that you have to betray at the turn before that, and so on, until you reach the conclusion that you can't cooperate at all.So is the student's reasoning correct or not?

Will we, after many games against itself, arrive at a program able to compete with or beat the best human players? And if so, how many games (in order of magnitude) would be needed for that? Or on the contrary, will such a program converge toward a much weaker player?I assume that the experiment has not been made, since AlphaGo is so recent. But the answer may nevertheless be obvious to a specialist. Otherwise any educated guess will interest me.One can also ask the same question for \"simpler\" games. If we use roughly the same reinforcement-learning technics used for AlphaGo, but with no use of human database, for a Chess program, would we eventually geta program able to beat the best human? And if so, how fast? Has this been tried? Or if not for Chess, what about Checkers, or even simpler games? Thanks a lot.", "query_id": 599}

{"query": "What is the right insight or intuition regarding difference (if any) between a resonance and a bound but unstable state?When we introduce quantum mechanics we might ask students to calculate the bound states for a potential well of some finite depth. In an introductory example the well might be $V(r)=0$ for $r &lt; a$ and $V(r)=V_0 &gt; 0$ for $r&gt;a$, for example, and then an energy eigenstate with $E &lt; V_0$ is strictly bound.Later on we might consider something like a Coulomb barrier with a strong-force well in the middle. Suppose the potential $V(r)$ goes to zero as $r \\rightarrow \\infty$ and has a  maximum $V_{\\rm max}$ at $r=a$. You can have energy eigenstates with energy $0&lt; E &lt; V_{\\rm max}$ and they have a character intermediate between bound and unbound. They are like bound states at small $r$, with exponential decay in the classically forbidden region, and then at large $r$ they extend to infinity like unbound states.I think there may be an inconsistency in standard terminology here. In nuclear physics an unstable nucleus is said to be in a 'bound state', albeit one that is unstable, so this suggests the kind of state I just described would be called 'bound'. But I think people studying quantum mechanics in the abstract would want to say such states are 'not bound'. Similar considerations apply to a molecule which can spontaneously dissociate or an atomic ion with an extra electron. A natural sense of the physics invites us to say 'bound but unstable', but a strict study of the eigenstates says 'not bound'. (If I am wrong about this confusion of terminology I would be glad to be corrected, but this is not my question here).In the &quot;Coulomb + well&quot; example there will be a continuum of states with $E &gt; V_{\\rm max}$ and within this continuum the density of states may have one or more pronounced peaks for $E$ larger than but near to $V_{\\rm max}$. This suggests that when we see a resonance in a scattering cross-section it is not possible to say, from that evidence alone, whether the state in question was bound or unbound. Is that right?My main question is,is there any difference (beyond the mere assertion $E &lt; V_{\\rm max}$ or $E &gt; V_{\\rm max}$) between a bound state with short lifetime and an unbound state whose energy is near such a resonance?", "query_id": 603}

Next they send a 3.7-microsecond long laser pulse into the caesium cell, which is 6 centimetres long, and show that, at the correct wavelength, it emerges from the cell 62 nanoseconds sooner than would be expected if it had travelled at the speed of light. 62 nanoseconds might not sound like much, but since it should only take 0.2 nanoseconds for the pulse to pass through the cell, this means that the pulse has been travelling at 310 times the speed of light. Moreover, unlike previous superluminal experiments, the input and output pulse shapes are essentially the same.\" I realise that the velocity of light in a medium is comprised of the phase velocity, the group velocity, and the front velocity.

{"query": "Are these two new ways of representing odd zeta values as integrals known?This is inspired by the same beautiful integral expression for $\\zeta(3)$ as this question, but goes in a slightly different direction. Writing the original integral in the form $$\\int_0^1\\frac{x(1-x)}{\\sin\\pi x}dx=7\\frac{\\zeta(3)}{\\pi^3} ,$$ it turns out that for $n\\in\\mathbb N$ there is a unique monic polynomial $p_n$ of degree $n-1$ such that $$\\int_0^1x^np_n(x)\\frac{1-x}{\\sin\\pi x}dx=c_{2n+1}\\frac{\\zeta(2n+1)}{\\pi^{2n+1} } $$ with rational $c_k=4(k-1)! \\dfrac{2^k-1}{2^k}= (4-2^{2-k})(k-1)! $.This follows for $\\zeta(2n+1)$ from solving the linear system given by the blue lines numbered $n+1,...,2n$ in the other question. As Zurab Silagadze answered it by giving an explicit formula of the coefficients in the blue lines, the $p_n$'s can be calculated. I don't know however if it is possible to give a formula in closed form (meaning here that it should not contain a matrix inversion), but see below.  The first polynomials are $$\\begin{align}p_1(x)&amp;=1 \\\\p_2(x)&amp;=3-x \\\\p_3(x)&amp;=25-20x+x^2 \\\\p_4(x)&amp;=455-707x+287x^2-x^3 \\\\p_5(x)&amp;=14301-34734x+29046x^2-8304x^3+x^4 \\\\p_6(x)&amp;=683067-2289309x+2949276x^2-1721434x^3+382547x^4-x^5 \\\\\\end{align}$$The constant terms are supposedly the sequence A272482, thus, correcting the oeis typo $$[x^0]p_n(x)=  {(2n)!}[x^{2n}y^n]\\frac{\\cos\\frac{x(1-y)}{2}} {\\cos\\frac{x(1+y)}{2}} = \\frac 1{4^n} {2n\\choose n}\\sum_{i=0}^n{n\\choose i}E_i,$$ where $E_i$ are the Euler numbers. This seems to suggest something similar for the other coefficients, and thus possibly a closed form.  Are the $p_n$ known? How to find their closed form or generating function?More generally now, define $$J(m,n,k)=J(n,m,k):= \\int_0^1\\frac{x^m(1-x)^n}{\\sin^k\\pi x}dx.$$For this to converge, we need $m,n\\geqslant k$.Experimentally, the situation for $k=2$ is quite similar to the $k=1$ case in that $J(m,n,k)$ is a rational combination of values $\\dfrac{\\zeta(i)}{\\pi^{i+1}}$ with $i$ running over all odd numbers between $\\min(m,n)$ and $m+n-1$, e.g. $$J(7,4,2)=\\dfrac{105}2\\left(-\\dfrac{\\zeta(5)}{\\pi^6}+51\\dfrac{\\zeta(7)}{\\pi^8}-405\\dfrac{\\zeta(9)}{\\pi^{10}}\\right).$$This leads to new possibilities of representing odd zeta values as integrals, this time with $\\sin^2\\pi x$ in the denominator. Writing as a shortcut $h_m:=J(m,m,2)$, we can for example express $\\dfrac{\\zeta(2n-1)}{\\pi^{2n}}$ as a rational combination of $h_2,\\dots,h_n$, i.e. as an integral  $$\\dfrac{\\zeta(2n-1)}{\\pi^{2n}}=\\int_0^1q_n(x-x^2)\\frac{x^2(1-x)^2}{\\sin^2\\pi x}dx,$$ where $q_n$ is a unique polynomial of degree $n-2$. The first of them are:$$\\begin{align} \\zeta(3)&amp;=\\frac{\\pi^4}{6}h_2 \\\\\\zeta(5)&amp;=\\frac{\\pi^6}{90}(h_2 +2h_3),\\qquad \\text{ i. e. } q_2(z)=\\frac{1}{90}(1+2z) \\quad \\text{ etc. }\\\\\\zeta(7)&amp;=\\frac{\\pi^8}{1890}(2h_2 +4h_3+3h_4)\\\\\\zeta(9)&amp;=\\frac{\\pi^{10}}{28350}(3h_2 +6h_3+5h_4+2h_5)\\\\\\zeta(11)&amp;=\\frac{\\pi^{12}}{935550}(10h_2 +20h_3+17h_4+8h_5+2h_6)\\\\\\zeta(13)&amp;=\\frac{\\pi^{14}}{638512875}(\\color{blue}{691}h_2 +1382h_3+1180h_4+574h_5+175h_6+30h_7)\\\\ \\end{align}$$Experimentally, in $\\dfrac{\\zeta(2n-1)}{\\pi^{2n}}$ the last coefficient (i.e. the one of $h_n$ and the leading term of $q_n$) is $\\dfrac{2^{2n-2}}{(2n)!}$ and the one preceding it is $\\dfrac{n(n-2)}6\\dfrac{2^{2n-2}}{(2n)!}$, while for the first coefficient (equally, the constant term of $q_n$), the occurrence of $\\color{blue}{691}$ in the expression for $\\zeta(13)$ suggests that it involves the Bernoulli number $B_{2n-2}$.      Any ideas about these polynomials?  Finally, for $k\\geqslant 3$ there does not seem to exist any closed form, at least not in terms of zeta values.

{"query": "What is an efficient nesting of mathematical theorems?Various mathematical areas of research evolved from a wide and diverse range of questions. Many are physical in nature or come from science, some are procedural or optimization problems and so on. Often patterns emerge and lead to studies of abstract structures and in this way extend our knowledge of what is considered pure mathematics. Often, the original context gets stripped off and eventually, in the process of generalization, formerly different frameworks can be seen under a new perspective. Under some circumstances notation might be introduced and new and sometimes more elegant proofs are discovered.If I have abstractly proven a statement, say for example in category theory (like the Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem), and I then choose one of several specific frameworks, which satisfies certain structural patterns, then I can draw conclusions from the more abstract theorem and state new ones as a lemma (like the classical Riemann-Roch theorem). There are many statements in diverse geometric theories (like Poisson, Symplectic, Riemann or Euclidean geometriy, Lie Group theory etc.), which can be viewed as really just the same theorem under different lights. If I prove Stokes theorem, I might avoid finding individual proofs for various kinds of integral theorems. The core of some statements in de Rham cohomology is already hidden in more abstract cohomology theories with less specific context. My question is ultimately concerned with such a nesting and is kind of an optimization problem. From the point of view of organization, one might consider drawing top-down conclusions more efficient than finding several more specific proofs. Lets assume one is interested in the bulk of major mathematical research areas and also able to draw all drawable conclusions for certain given axioms. It then seems to me that the following order of analysis seems like an suitable one: Introducing the notion of an abstract set, introducting all the various logics in an intelligent order, introduce abstract algebra followed by the category theoretic framework and then various more specific sets with axioms which make up relevant structures (including topology, numbers, modules, vector spaces, geometries,...). All the time with some intelligent order in mind, i.e. jumping from special case to special case in a minimalist way, even if there might not be an optimal way to do so, of course. Encyclopedic web pages like Wikipedia, MathWorld or comprehensive treatises give a rough conception of how this may work. (Personally, there are a couple of ambiguities for me, especially regarding the points at which I just have to introduce set theory. For example, I don't know if you really have to introduce sentences as objects in propositional calculus or what other big areas are explicable in non-set theoretic terms, even if they usually are explained that way. I also have little insight in modern model theoretic perspective.) Having said that: What would be an (or maybe the) efficient order to introduce the mathematical frameworks (of current knowledge, state of the art and relevance), and why? Here the term \"efficient\" is understood in the sense explained above.I would not be surprised if there are different good ways to approach this. But in any case, there are obviously theorems which include others and since one can put many mathematical disciplines on their own feet, there is some unambitious pyramiding. A more synthesizing formulation of the above question, one stated in terms of the specific fields, would be to ask: Which are major mathematical theorems, which are strongly including in this sense? Which are theorems which have an unnegligible power with regard to special cases or sub-theorems and would therefore be worth of being proven first? As another approach, a start might be to find out which axioms are really necessary, i.e. doing reverse mathematics.", "query_id": 649}

I find the literature quite hard to follow -\"from experts, for experts\".Voevodsky in \"Triangulated categories of motives over a field\" [4.3.8] shows that there is no reasonable t-structure on his category $DM^{eff}_{gm}(k)$ (for $k=\\mathbb Q$ or most fields, characterized it seems by a certain cohomological dimension condition which flies above my head) but I do not quite understand the meaning of his proof, in particular how he came up with it, though I more or less follow individual steps. Can anyone help me?Related to this are Bruno Kahn's remarks in his review article in the \"Handbook of K-theory\" that the etale version of $DM_{gm,et}^{eff}(k)$, with Homsets isomorphic to $DM^{eff}_{gm}(k)$'s after tensoring by $\\mathbb Q$ (using some motivic scissoring magic I presume), should have a t-structure whose heart should be (equivalent to) Nori's category. Kahn says this is related to the Hodge conjecture (not \"Hodge-type standard\"), can anyone flesh this relation out here?So I wonder what happens when we pass from $gm$ to $gm,et$. Does anybody know? Is it related to (Serre-type) supersingularity-based counterexamples to the existence of a Weil cohomology theory with $\\mathbb Q$ or $\\mathbb Q_p$ coefficients?Also, what has been done to relate the cohomological t-structure on the bounded derived category of Nori mixed motives to $DM_{gm,et}^{eff}(k)$? ($DM_{gm}^{eff}(k)$ and $DM_{gm,et}^{eff}(k)$ have a canonical functor to $D^b(NMM(k))$, which should be an equivalence after tensoring with $\\mathbb Q$ -Beilinson's \"mixed motives\" conjecture.)Are these questions related to CM lifting results of Chai-Conrad-Oort? Do their constructions explain why there is no t-structure for Nisnevich triangulated motives but there is for etale triangulated motives? Should Voevodsky's example be interpreted in that context?As you see I am starting to divagate, so I would greatly appreciate some enlightenment.I would also appreciate any comment on the feeling (probably quite ill-informed) that the t-structure on $DM_{gm,et}^{eff}(k)$ should not be too hard to construct but rather a matter of technical mastery of the involved.And along this line, would the existence of that t-structure yield insight on the Tate and Hodge conjectures, or other conjectures on algebraic cycles? Those seem harder but to confirm (and following Kahn's remark mentioned above): does the Hodge conjecture imply the existence of the motivic t-structure on $DM_{gm,et}^{eff}(k)$?Finally, I hesitate asking more but... Has anything been tried regarding \"bootstrapping\" the thorough understanding we have of t-structures on Tate motives to construct t-structures on larger triangulated categories of motives? I think I remember something from Déglise, I have to check... And have those constructions on Tate motives been related to the Nori-Kontsevich tannakian philosophy -e.g. to a hypothetical bootstrapping?", "query_id": 657}

{"query": "Is rule 30 Turing complete? Is there a proof that it isn&#39;t?It is well known that the elementary cellular automaton known as rule 110 is Turing complete.Its cousin rule 30 also produces complicated behaviour. When I read Wolfram's a New Kind of Science (in which these rules are defined), I vaguely recall his opinion being that rule 30 probably isn't Turing complete, because its behaviour is \"too chaotic\" - you tend not to get the localised regions of order that can be found in the dynamics of Rule 110, which probably makes it impossible for it to simulate a Turing machine in the same way.If I recall correctly, there was no proof of this in the book. But that was many years ago. I would like to know if this intuition has been proven or disproven yet: has rule 30 been shown to be Turing complete, or is there now a proof that it cannot be?If there is such a proof (or even if there isn't), I'd be interested to know what form it takes. In the case where something is Turing complete, one usually proves it by simulation: you use the system to implement a universal Turing machine, or some other thing that's known to be Turing complete. In the cases where something is too simple to be Turing complete, there are a number of ways to show this. (For example, you could show that every relevant question about its dynamics can be answered by a Turing machine that always halts.) However, in the case where something fails to be Turing complete because it's \"too chaotic\" in this way, I have no good intuition about how this could be shown.", "query_id": 659}

{"query": "What counts as a measurement?In quantum mechanics, an elementary particle does not have a well defined position until a measurement is performed on it (right?).  Such a \"measurement\" is any sort of interaction with other particles that gives those particles information about the position of the first particle.  However, systems of elementary particles, such as atoms or buckyballs, can also cumulatively lack a well-defined position, which is why the double slit experiment can be performed with atoms and buckyballs.  It thus seems that interaction with just any other elementary particle is not enough to collapse the wave function.  If this is the case, it would seem that an arbitrarily large system of known elementary particles could lack a well-defined position because they would be insufficient to collapse each other's wave functions.

{"query": "When is an elliptic integral expressible in terms of elementary functions?After seeing this recent question asking how to calculate the following integral$$ \\int \\frac{1 + x^2}{(1 - x^2) \\sqrt{1 + x^4}} \\, dx $$and some of the comments that suggested that it was an elliptic integral, I tried reading a little bit on the Wikipedia article about elliptic integrals.It seems that the point is that most elliptic integrals cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. The Wikipedia article defines an elliptic integral as an integral of the form$$\\int R \\left( x, \\sqrt{ P(x) } \\right ) \\, dx$$where $R(x, y)$ is a rational function and $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $3$ or $4$ with no repeated roots.Now, the article does mention in its introductory section that two exceptions in which the elliptic integrals can be expressed in terms of elementary functions are when the polynomial $P(x)$ has repeated roots or when the rational function $R(x, y)$ does not contain odd powers of $y$. In the example in question we have $P(x) = 1 + x^4$ and $$R(x, y) = \\frac{1 + x^2}{(1 - x^2)y}$$so certainly it does not correspond to the two exceptions mentioned before. Thus I have a couple of questions about this:  1) What are the conditions for an elliptic integral (as defined in the Wikipedia article) to be expressible in terms of elementary functions? More specifically, are the two above cited conditions the only exceptions or are there any others which may explain why the above integral is expressible in terms of elementary functions?    2) Depending on the answer to my first question, why is it that the above \"elliptic integral\" can be expressed in terms of elementary functions?Note: I'm not sure but I suppose that some conditions must be put on the rational function $R(x, y)$ so to avoid trivial cases, but I don't want to speculate.Thank you very much in advance.", "query_id": 664}
{"query": "Best practice to handle double negatives when using the expectancy-value model?My question is regarding the multiplicative combination rule in the Expectancy-value model developed by Fishbein and Ajzen, and the issues regarding the expectancy value-muddle, or the case of \"double negatives,\" in the multiplicative combination.For my master thesis, I conducted a questionnaire toward a sample of people and asked questions about their attitudes toward a hospitality company. My intention is to derive their attitudes with the help from the expectancy-value model:$$\\ a=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{i}e_{i}$$a is one respondent's attitude towards the object.$$\\ b_i$$ is the belief that the object has the attributei.$$\\ e_i$$ is the evaluation of the attribute.a is one respondent's attitude toward the object.$b_i$ is the belief that the object has the attributei.$e_i$ is the evaluation of the attribute i.The first question (e) accesses the respondent's opinion of the importance of attribute i (e.g. central location), and the second question (b) accesses the respondent's belief that the hospitality company will deliver attribute i. I also have a direct attitude variable, which is not in the scope of this problem unless it is, of course, a part of the solution.The respondents choose one alternative on a bipolar semantic differential scale with the extremes between \"unimportant - important\" (e) and \"unlikely - likely\" (b) for every attribute with a coded scale between -3 to +3.The attitude points are compared with various hypothesis t-test. One independent t-test between the experimental group and the control group. And one dependent t-test to investigate a difference within the groups.It's beyond the scope of the examination to carry out a focus group to elicit the attributes from a representative sample of the population (hospitality company customers). Thus, the reason to use a bipolar scale to \"permit\" a negative response e.g. \"unlikely\" instead of \"slightly likely\" on the lower scale:  \"For example, when - as part of belief elicitation - a person indicates 'my drinking alcohol makes me nauseous,' it is reasonable to use, for that person a unipolar scale to assess the strength of this belief. However, when the same statement is presented to an individual who did not personally emit it, the individual may well judge it to be highly unlikely or false. To permit this kind of response, a bipolar belief scale should be used, such as a seven-point scale ranging from unlikely to likely or fall to true.\" (Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010, p.106)A problematic issue, the expectancy-value muddle or the case of the double negative, occurs when the respondents answer with a negative evaluation and belief. Newton et al. (2011, p.3) claim that the phenomenon \"expectancy-value muddle\" occurs since the b*e \"computation are uninterpretable\":  \"if both responses were coded on bipolar scales, then the individual would receive the highest score possible due to the multiplication of the two negative terms (-3*-3=9). Thus, the ranking of scores in the expectancy-value framework becomes contingent upon the method of scaling used. Hence, the rankings of expectancy-value scores are dependent on item scaling can have important implications for the analysis and interpretation of results.\" (Newton et al., 2011, p.2-3)Fishbein and Ajzen have also dealt with this problem; French and Hankins (2003) explain the 'psychology of the double negative', which was originally presented by Ajzen and Fishbein (1980):  \"The rationale given by Fishbein and Ajzen for the scoring system adopted is based on what they term the ‘psychology of the double negative’. For instance, if an ‘expectancy’ belief and its associated evaluation were both scored from - 3 to + 3, as recommended by Ajzen and Fishbein (1980), an individual who indicated that (s)he thought an outcome was both likely and good would score the maximum possible (+ 3 * + 3 = + 9), as would an individual who thought the outcome was both unlikely and bad (-3 * -3 = + 9). That is, a negatively valued consequence with a perceived low probability of occurring is thought to be as much a reason for inferring a positive attitude as a positively valued consequence with a perceived high probability of occurring. Note that, according to this viewpoint, the distant positions have led to the same numerical outcome.\" (French &amp; Hankins, 2003, p.39)Fishbein and Ajzen thus state that bipolar scaling is the best choice:  \"In sum, evidence available to date indicates that bipolar scoring is generally superior to unipolar scoring of behavioral beliefs.\" (Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2008, p.2231)And they have also stated that the multiplicative combination is correct:  \"We thus conclude that the multiplication of belief strength and outcome evaluation, which is at the core of the expectancy-value model, is a reasonable and well-supported assumption.\" (Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010, p.118)What puzzles me is that Fishbein and Ajzen, both in 2008 and 2010, have suggested to convert from a bipolar to a unipolar scale after the data has been collected:  \"Even though the shift from unipolar to bipolar scoring involves a simple linear transformation (i.e., subtraction by 4), it results in a nonlinear transformation of the product term (be). This can be seen in the following computation where the original values of b are transformed by the addition of a constant B, and the values of e by a constant E. For simplicity, only one behavioral belief is entered into the expectancy–value equation:    $$\\ A_{B}\\propto(b+B)(e+E)\\propto be+Eb+Be+BE$$    In practice, however, the impact of a linear transformation is often relatively small as a result of a restricted range of belief strength or outcome evaluation scores. In the limiting condition in which scores on either variable are the same for all participants, a linear transformation of that variable will  result in a linear transformation of the b * e product, thus having no effect on correlations with external criteria.\" (Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2008, p.2226-2226)To conclude, both French and Hankins (2003) and Newton et al. (2011) problematize the multiplicative combination because of the double negatives, also called the expectancy-value muddle.They do suggest various solutions but recommend two other models developed by Schmidt (1973) and Haddock and Zanna (1998), the \"expectancy-valence model\" and \"open-ended measures of attitudinal components,\" respectively.These models, however, are not applicable to my problem. I have already carried out questionnaires that do have double negatives in the resulting data.I'm considering to either use the suggestion by Fishbein and Ajzen (2008) or to accept this issue as a \"psychology of the double negative\" presented by the same authors (1980).But I'm not sure, and that's why I'm reaching out to this community to ask: What is the best and common practice to overcome this issue with double negatives when using the expectancy-value model?BibliographyAjzen, I., &amp; Fishbein, M.

{"query": "Intuition for Class NumbersSo I've been thinking about the analytic class number formula lately, and class numbers in general and I'm trying to develop a good intuition for them. My basic question, which may be too is: $\\textbf{What forces the class number of a number field to be large?}$If you like, an answer for a class of fields such as quadratic fields would be helpful. Here's my intuition: I know that every ideal class has to contain a split prime, so if I wanted to construct a quadratic extension of Q with a large class number, I would try to find one where lots of small primes split, because once the primes get too large, they have to compete with things such as the Minkowski bound, and no longer help the class number grow. A prime $q$ splits in $\\mathbb Q(\\sqrt{p})$ iff $\\left ( \\frac{p}{q} \\right) =1$. Now you can apply quadratic reciprocity to translate this to a congruence condition mod $p$. To me, this says that primes splitting should be related to the class number.More concretely, by the analytic class number formula, for real quadratic fields  we have that $h=\\frac{\\sqrt{D}}{log(\\epsilon)} L(1, \\chi)$, where $\\epsilon$ is the unique fundamental unit greater than $1$. For imaginary quadratic fields (excluding $\\mathbb Q(i)$ and $\\mathbb Q(\\sqrt{-3})$, we have $h=\\frac{\\sqrt{|D|}}{\\pi} L(1, \\chi) $. So in general it seems like to make $h$ large, we need to make $L(1,\\chi)$ large, which (I believe) is trying to find lots of small quadratic residues mod $m$, where your field is $\\mathbb Q(\\sqrt{m})$. This seems to work okay for imaginary quadratic fields. For example, $\\mathbb Q(\\sqrt{-163})$ is able to have a small class number because $\\left (\\frac{p}{163} \\right )= -1$  for $p&lt;41$ when $p$ is prime.Real quadratic fields seem trickier, because it isn't enough to control $L(1, \\chi)$, you also have to worry about the fundamental unit, and I'm afraid I don't have much intuition for that.

{"query": "$f(ax)=f(x)^2-1$, what is $f$?Suppose $f(ax)=(f(x))^2-1$ and suppose that $f$ is analytic in some neighborhood of $x=0$. Expanding in power series, we get$a=1+\\sqrt{5}$ or $1-\\sqrt{5}$. We take positive $a$. If $f\\neq{\\rm const}$ then $f'(0)\\neq0$ - it can be any non-zero number. After that, we can uniquely define coefficients in power series step by step using differentiation of the functional equation$$ f(0)=f(0)^2-1\\ \\Rightarrow\\ f(0)=\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{5}}2;\\ 2f'(0)f(0)=af'(0)\\ \\Rightarrow\\ \\ 2f''(0)f(0)+2(f'(0))^2=a^2f''(0)\\ \\Rightarrow\\ f''(0)=\\frac{2(f'(0))^2}{a^2-a};\\ \\ ....$$ Can $f$ be expressed in terms of some known functions?It seems that $f$ is entire function of order $1$. Indeed, due to the Leibnitz formula, we have$$ a^nf^{(n)}(0)=\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}f^{(n-k)}(0)f^{(k)}(0),$$which leads to\\begin{equation}\\label{l1} f^{(n)}(0)=\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\binom{n}{k}f^{(n-k)}(0)f^{(k)}(0)}{a^n-a}.\\end{equation}It is true that $|f''(0)|\\leq|f'(0)|^2=:C^2$, see above. Suppose that we already proved $|f^{(k)}(0)|\\leq C^k$, $1\\leq k\\leq n-1$. Then $$ |f^{(n)}(0)|\\leq \\frac{C^n2^n}{(\\sqrt{5}+1)^{n-1}\\sqrt{5}}\\leq C^n.$$Hence, the power series converges everywhere and $|f(x)|\\leq|f(0)|+e^{C|x|}-1$, $x\\in\\mathbb{C}$.(The functional equation is somewhat similar to $\\cos 2x=2\\cos^2x-1$.If we denote then $$ g'(x)=g'(0)g(a^{-1}x)g(a^{-2}x)g(a^{-3}x)....$$Also, the polynomial $$ P_n(x)=f(a^nf^{-1}(x))=P\\circ...\\circ P(x),\\ \\ \\ P(x)=x^2-1$$is some analog of Chebyshev polynomial $T_{2^n}(x)$. The polynomials $P_n(x)$ are related to the representations of some class of infinite Lie algebras, but I forgot the story behind that...)Remark. It is seen that $f(\\lambda x)$ satisfies also the functional equation, for any $\\lambda$. So, we can choose $f'(0)$ freely. Instead of this, let us choose the closest to $0$ zero as $x_0:=1$ (if zeroes exist), i.e. $f(1)=0$. Then $f(a^{-1})=1$ (not $-1$, since $x_0$ is the first zero and $f(0)&gt;0$). Applying again the functional equation, we get $$ f(1)=0,\\ f(a^{-1})=1,\\ f(a^{-2})=\\sqrt{2},\\ ...,\\  f(a^{-n})=\\sqrt{1+f(a^{-n+1})},\\ ....$$ Theoretically, we can recover $f(x)$ from infinite number of values $f(a^{-n})$ covergent to next statement is wrong because, perhaps, $f$ can have complex zeros along with real zeros. I leave it just for possible improvements. Due to $f'(ax)=2a^{-1}f(x)f'(x)=(2a^{-1})^2f(x)f(a^{-1}x)f'(a^{-1}x)=...$ (see above infinite product for $g$), we can conclude that $f'(x)\\neq0$ for $x\\in[0,a)$ and, hence $f$ is monotonic on this interval.  $f$ is also monotonic for $x\\in(a,a^2)$, since $f'(ax)=2a^{-1}f(x)f'(x)$. Due to $f(a^2x)=f(x)^2(f(x)^2-2)$, we see that $x_1=a^2$ is a double zero, $x_2=a^4$ is a zero of fourth order, etc. Following the same arguments as above, there are no other zeroes. Then$$ f(x)=e^{h(x)}\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{x}{a^{2n}}\\right)^{2^n}.$$Is $h(x)=\\ln a-\\ln 2$? Perhaps, something wrong can be here... but if this is true then$$ \\ln f(x)=\\ln a-\\ln 2-\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{a^{2k}x^k}{k(a^{2k}-2)}$$or something like that.While the previous section was wrong, the true Hadamard expansion perhaps exist. This is still rough. Let $\\{x_r\\}$ be the smallest primitive zeros of $f$, such that all are other zeroes are $a^{2n}x_r$. Dentote - I do not know about the convergence of the product, I am trying to explain some ideas. We can follow the arguments from the wrong section above. Then, perhaps, it is true that$$ f(x)=\\frac{a e^{dx}}{2}\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}H\\left(\\frac x{a^{2n}}\\right)^{2^n}$$with some constant $d$ (I hope it is $0$), since the order of $f$ does not exceed $1$. Substituting this identity into $f(a^2x)=f(x)^2(f(x)^2-2)$ we obtain also$$ (see above $g$), we obtain$$ f'(x)=f'(0)e^{\\frac{dx}{a-1}}\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}H\\left(\\frac{x}{a^{2n}}\\right)^{2^n-1}\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}H\\left(\\frac{x}{a^{2n-1}}\\right)^{2^n-1}.$$It is possible to obtain other formulas.There is also another motivation to study $f$:$$ f(a^nx)=P\\circ..\\circ P(f(x)),\\ \\ P(x)=x^2-1.$$Thus, we can try to analyze the stability of values $f(z)$ under the action of the group of polynomials. This question is related to dynamical systems, fractals... Maybe the dynamical systems community already studied such analytic functions?There is an exact relation to fractals and holomorphic dynamics. Using $f(z)=P\\circ...\\circ P(f(a^{-n}z))$, $P(z)=z^2-1$, we obtain that if $z_0$ (located in the strip $S_n:=\\{z:\\ a^n\\leq|z_0|&lt;a^{n+1}\\}$) is a primitive zero of $f$, i.e. $f(a^{-k}z)\\neq0$, $k\\geq1$, then $f(a^{-n}z_0)$ is a non-trivial root of the polynomial $P_n=P^{\\circ n}$. All such non-trivia roots have the form$$ q= s_0\\sqrt{1+s_1\\sqrt{1+...+s_{n-1}\\sqrt{1+s_n\\sqrt{2}}}},$$where $s_j\\in\\{-1,1\\}$. Without loss of generality, consider the case $f'(0)=1$. Then, for sufficiently large $n_0$, we have$$ \\frac{a}2+a^{-n-n_0}z_0\\approx f(a^{-n-n_0}z_0)= s_0\\sqrt{1+s_1\\sqrt{1+...+s_{n-1}\\sqrt{1+s_n\\sqrt{2}}}}.$$Hence$$ a^{-n-n_0}z_0\\approx s_0\\sqrt{1+s_1\\sqrt{1+...+s_{n-1}\\sqrt{1+s_n\\sqrt{2}}}}-\\frac{a}2(=q)$$and all such $q$ lying in $a^{-n_0}\\leq|q|&lt;a^{-n_0+1}$ correspond to primitive roots of $f$ lying in $S_n$. I have computed them for $n=20$ (and $n_0=4$):It looks like a Julia set. So, zeros of $f$ (even primitive zeros) are very complex. I hope I did not make large mistakes somewhere...It is also possible to introduce more general functions satisfying$$ f(ax)=bf(x)^2+cf(x)+d\\ \\ \\ {\\rm or\\ even}\\ \\ \\ f(ax)=Q(f(x)) $$with some polynomial or rational $Q$. Such class of functions contain $\\sin,\\cos,\\exp,...$One of the main questions is still open: are there any relations between $f$ and some known functions?Of course, any information about asymptotics, expansions, numerical results, differential equations, etc. is very welcome.A relation with the approximation of the golden ratio. Finally, I found one relation with more or less known functions. Consider$$ g(z)=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a^n\\biggl(\\underbrace{\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{1+...\\sqrt{1+z}}}}_n-\\frac{a}2\\biggr).$$The function $g$ is analytic (not entire), it is considered in Paris, R. B. \"An Asymptotic Approximation Connected with the Golden Number.\" Amer. Math. Monthly 94, 272-278, 1987. It satisfies the functional equation$$ g(z)=ag(\\sqrt{1+z}).$$Hence, $f$ is exactly the inverse function to $g$. It is useful to note that $g'$ admits an explicit representation$$ g'(z)=\\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{1+z}}\\cdot\\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{1+z}}}....$$Edit - 04 June 2019. There are few remarks: due to the product expansion for $g'(x)$, all primitive zeros are simple and each simple zero of $f$ is primitive. Due to the comments and answers below (many thanks to the authors), the order of $f$ is $\\rho=\\ln a&lt;1$. This value can be obtained by substituting $e^{A|z|^{\\rho}}$ into $f(az)=f(z)^2-1$, which gives $a^{\\rho}=2$. Because the order $\\rho&lt;1$, we have $d=0$ in the Weierstrass-Hadamard expansion. Something like this... For me, it was a bit strange to see the more or less explicit entire function $f$ whose zeros form fractals.Edit - 05 June 2019 As mentioned above, the function $f$ has a lot of multiple roots. There is a linear transform which leaves simple roots of only. Without loss of generality, consider the case $f'(0)=1$.

Some examples I know:1) Finite set case: functions from $\\lbrace 1,2,\\dots,n\\rbrace$ to itself is one-one iff onto.2) Linear operators $T\\colon V\\rightarrow V,$ where $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space is also one-one iff onto.3) Linear operators of the from (I-K) where K is some compact operator acting on a Banach space satisfies this property. This is the famous result of Fredholm. It is very easy to find domains where the result fails. I remember my teacher telling me that 'compactness is the next best thing to finiteness', hence this result which trivially holds in the finite case can happen only in the compact setting. I would like to know, if this is really the case or are there any other examples? Thank you in advance.

From various papers I've seen that if you want to use inductive GNNs like GraphSAGE, it is advisable to split your data into two separate graphs or components.Since I've seen that there are different approaches for node classification and link prediction tasks, I am specifically interested in node classification tasks, possible multiclass classification.So the split graphs would need to ensure some sort of reasonable class presence in both train and test graphs as well as avoid isolated nodes. I've seen some example where they simply use scikit split, but to me it seems it disregards node connections and there is no guarantee you won't be left with isolated nodes that could skew results.Could I use something as Louvain, to find communities of nodes, and then split the graph based on communities.

{"query": "Which learning tasks do brains use to train themselves to see?In computer vision is very common to use supervised tasks, where datasets have to be manually annotated by humans. Some examples are object classification (class labels), detection (bounding boxes) and segmentation (pixel-level masks). These datasets are essentially pairs of inputs-outputs which are used to train Convolutional Neural Networks to learn the mapping from inputs to outputs, via gradient descent optimization. But animals don't need anybody to show them bounding boxes or masks on top of things in order for them to learn to detect objects and make sense of the visual world around them. This leads me to think that brains must be performing some sort of self-supervision to train themselves to see.What does current research say about the learning paradigm used by brains to achieve such an outstanding level of visual competence? Which tasks do brains use to train themselves to be so good at processing visual information and making sense of the visual world around them?

If A is any set of reals, then it can be viewed as an order structure itself under the induced order (A,&lt;). The question is, when is this structure rigid? That is, for which sets A does the structure (A,&lt;) have no nontrivial order automorphisms? For example, the positive integers are rigid under the usual order. More generally, any well-ordered subset of R is rigid. Similarly, any anti-well-ordered set, such as the negative integers, is also rigid. It is also true that the order sum of any well-order plus an anti-well-order is rigid. For example, a sequence converging upward to 0 plus a sequence converging downward to 0 will have order type &omega;+&omega;*, which is rigid.  (Whereas it is easy to see that the sum of an infinite anti-well-order and an infinite  well-order will not be rigid, since it has a copy of Z in the center.)

{"query": "A geometric Ramsey problemThe following problem seems like one to which the answer could well be known: if so, I'd be interested to have a reference.How large does n have to be such that among any n points in the plane you can find either m points that are collinear or m points such that no three are collinear? The fact that n is finite follows from Ramsey's theorem: colour triples of points according to whether they are collinear.However, as with many geometric colourings, far better bounds hold than what one can obtain from the abstract Ramsey theorem. Here are what seem to me to be the trivial bounds. In one direction, an m-by-m grid of points does not contain more than m in a line, but if you choose 2m+1 of the points then you must have three that are collinear. So you need at least $cm^2$ points. (It's not quite obvious that you can choose linearly many points in this grid with no three in a line, but an old idea of Erd&#337;s does the trick: assume that m is prime and choose all points (x,y) such that $y\\equiv x^2$ mod m. It is not hard to check that this set does not contain three points that are in a line even in the mod-m sense, so certainly not in the integer sense. If m isn't prime, then discard a few points until it is.) In the other direction, you can just greedily pick points such that no three are collinear. If you reach r points and then cannot extend your set, then all subsequent points lie in one of the $\\binom r2$ lines defined by the points so far. Therefore, there must be points in a line, by the pigeonhole principle. It follows that it is enough if $n=cm^3$. My question is, is one of these two bounds known to be correct (up to $n^{o(1)}$), and if so which? It feels quite close to known incidence results: another possibility is that a simple adaptation of a known argument would answer the question. The one thing that suggests that it might be hard is the fact that it takes a slight effort to find that set of points in the grid with no three in a line.", "query_id": 695}

{"query": "Vanishing of characteristic numbers vs vanishing of characteristic classesA famous result by Thom states that Oriented Bordism classes are determined by characteristic numbers; specifically, two closed manifolds are orientedly bordant if and only if they have the same Stiefel-Whitney and Pontryagin numbers (I'll just talk about Stiefel-Whitney for brevity).  An immediate consequence is that if $M$ is a closed manifold which has a non-vanishing Stiefel-Whitney number involving $w_k$ for some $k$, then $w_k(N)\\neq 0$ for any $N$ which is bordant to $M$; in other words this non-vanishing characteristic number provides a \"bordism reason\" for why a characteristic class should be non-zero.My question concerns the converse.  Given an $M$, suppose that for some $k$ every Steifel-Whitney number involving $w_k$ vanishes, so that there is \"no bordism reason\" for the class to be non-vanishing: is it then possible to find an $N$ which is bordant to $M$ and has $w_k(N)=0$?  If so, is it possible to simultaneously eliminate all classes which have no bordism reason to be non-zero?This seems like something which maybe shouldn't be expected since characteristic classes often provide obstructions to doing surgery, and two manifolds are orientedly bordant exactly when they differ by a finite sequence of surgeries.  On the other hand the manifold $\\mathbb{CP}^n\\#\\overline{\\mathbb{CP}^n}$ is null-bordant even though it has many non-vanishing characteristic classes for $n&gt;1$ (half the time it isn't even spin).", "query_id": 709}
{"query": "Where does choice enter into Buddhist practice?I am curious about what, if anything, gets said, especially those trained a buddhist background.Personally and currently, I am having the understanding that the ability to say 'no' to the influence of another person seems incredibly important.While life in general seems like it denies the ability to say 'no' to it, this seems all the more reason one should not remove another's capacity to reject another person. The difference in a personal practice at an advanced level seems like it ultimately could mean the difference in losing your own will to another person versus the same process happening within yourself. The former is tragic, the latter freedom. This would be why Buddhist teachers don't ask for things and why their poverty is crucial. The act of asking only for what one needs serves more than just to humble yourself, rather to be humble with clear understanding as to why, means to acknowledge the intrinsic value of another person outside of your own influence.This is also why meditation is a solo pursuit, as it gets you focussing on your own intrinsic value.Without the ability to deny another, or perhaps without both freely and joyfully pursuing the relationship, it's like they key to everything gets lost.I know that the buddha said no to people. I have enormous fears of people submitting to AI and losing free will that way, as the AI is not capable of being what it needs to be for that sort of relationship to happen. I have fears of where current privacy gets removed and the karmic influence tightens to a breaking point.How do the great buddhist teachers understand the current situation of AI, data mining, etc?I know the capacity for enslavement has never been higher due to all this.

Suppose the object 2 has a dual.  Does it follow that C is a category with biproducts?Longer version, with motivation: Let (C, &otimes;, 1) be a locally presentable closed symmetric monoidal category.  If you don't know what \"locally presentable\" means, you can replace these conditions with \"complete and cocomplete symmetric monoidal category in which &otimes; commutes with colimits in each variable\".  Familiar examples include (Set, &times;, &bull;), (Set*, &and;, S0) (the category of pointed sets with the smash product), and (Ab, &otimes;, &#8484;).  Any such category C has a unique \"unit\" functor FC : Set &rarr; C preserving colimits and the unit object: the set S is sent to the coproduct in C of S copies of 1.  For a nonnegative integer n, let me also write n for the image under this functor of the n-element set.  For instance, 0 represents the initial object of C.A dual for an object X of C is another object X* together with maps 1 &rarr; X &otimes; X* and X* &otimes; X &rarr; 1 which satisfy the triangular identities; see wikipedia for more details.  The data of X* together with these maps is unique up to unique isomorphism if it exists, so it makes sense to ask whether an object has a dual or not.I'm interested in the relationship between which objects in the image of FC have duals and the existence of more familiar structures on C.  In our examples,C = Set: Only 1 has a dual.C = Set*: Only 1 and 0 = &bull; have duals.C = Ab: n has a dual for any nonnegative integer n.It's easy to show that 1 is always its own dual, and slightly less trivially, that 0 has a dual iff 0 is also a final object, i.e., C has a zero object, or equivalently C is enriched in Set*.  Moreover, if C is semiadditive, i.e., enriched in commutative monoids, or equivalently has biproducts, then n has a dual (in fact, n is its own dual) for every nonnegative integer n.  Conversely, if 0 has a dual, so that C is pointed, and 2 also has a dual, then there is a canonical map 2 = 1 ∐ 1 &rarr; 1 &times; 1 = 2*.  My question, then, is: is this map is always an isomorphism?  Or, could it happen that 2* exists but is not isomorphic to 2 via this map?", "query_id": 712}

I shall restrict myself to $\\frac{\\lambda \\phi^4}{4!}$ perturbed real scalar quantum field theory and call as \"symmetry factor\" of a Feynman diagram to be the eventual number by which the power of $\\lambda$ is divided in the final integral representation of the diagram. In that way the symmetry factor of the figure of eight vacuum bubble is 8 and of the \"tadpole diagram\" it is 2. One way to get this factor right is to count the number of ways the free arms in the \"pre-diagram\" can be contracted. But this is more like a cook-book rule than an understanding of how the factor comes. I believe the most conceptually correct way is to count for every diagram the number of  terms in the representation as a functional derivative of the path-integral which give that diagram.

In this case we can tell how much processing goes into sub-routine by simple counting the number of steps each subroutine holds the processor.

This comment appears on page 219 in the book (Klein, Felix Elementary mathematics from an advanced standpoint. Arithmetic, algebra, analysis) originally published in 1908 in German. Question 1: When Klein writes that none of the current investigators have achieved, etc., who is he referring to? There were a number of people working \"in this direction\" at the time, and it would be interesting to know whose work Klein had in mind: Stolz, Paul du Bois-Raymond (somewhat earlier), Hahn, Hilbert, etc. Question 2: Did Klein elaborate in this direction in other works of his? Question 3: As noted in this article, A. Fraenkel formulated a similar criterion to Klein's for what it would take for a theory of infinitesimals to be successful (also in terms of the mean value theorem). Did other authors express related sentiments of measuring success in terms of being able to implement the MVT?", "query_id": 742}

{"query": "Research on &quot;probabilistic thinking&quot; in non-human animals?We all seem to have a \"probabilistic sense\", which manifests itself in certain types of expectations (e.g. even if one has never used a bow to shoot an arrow, one expects that hitting a small target will be more difficult than hitting a large target, all other things being equal), and also in certain characteristic responses when events do not match those expectations (these responses consist primarily of surprise, but also include suspicion, and in extreme cases maybe even awe or fear).For me at least, this probabilistic sense feels subjectively very fundamental, in the same way that physical pain, hunger, thirst, etc., \"feel fundamental\".  In other words, I could not describe them to someone in simpler terms.  (I may be able to explain to someone the mechanics of shooting an arrow with a bow, but I would not know how to explain to someone how to feel the immediate intuition that hitting a small target would be harder than hitting a large one.)Motivated by the kind of questions that follow, I'm looking for a review of research on \"probabilistic thinking\" by non-human animals.How analogous is this \"probabilistic sense\" to the more traditional   (\"classical\") senses like vision and touch?In particular, how much does it depends on human culture?I've searched for these keywords online, but I have not come up with anything.  Maybe I'm not using the right keywords.  Also, since probabilistic methods as standard tools in research (and hence, the research literature is awash in terms like \"probability\", \"expectation\", \"Bayesian\", \"statistical\", etc.), it is very difficult to craft searches that are selective for the research I'm looking for.  Some specific pointers (i.e., to specific papers, or books, or at least specific researchers) would be appreciated.FWIW, the clearest example I can come up with to illustrate what I mean by \"probabilistic thinking\" is this thought experiment.  Imagine presenting a human subject the opportunity to participate in a raffle for some prize that the subject finds desirable, and suppose the subject is just told that has the choice of having (A) one, or (B) two tickets for the raffle (at no cost in either case).  We would expect, of course, that every \"normal\" subject would prefer (B) over (A).  (In fact we would question the sanity (or at least the seriousness and sincerity) of any subject who fully understood the situation, and still preferred (A) over (B).)What makes the universal preference for (B) an example of \"probabilistic thinking\" is the simultaneous recognition on the subject's part that choice (B) is unequivocally better, and that still it could fail to lead to the prize, even if the raffle had only three tickets.I'm not sure how one would go about setting such an experiment with non-human animals, but I've been impressed before by the ingenuity of the experiments that researchers devise to test animal cognition, so I remain hopeful that something like the \"probabilistic thinking\" I illustrate above has been investigated.That said, I realize that it would be rather difficulty is to distinguish between pure \"probabilistic thinking\" (as a distinct, independent faculty) and conditioning.  In fact, it can be (and has been) argued that what I'm calling \"probabilistic thinking\" is nothing more than a special case of conditioning.  (After all, conditioning may be thought of as the nurturing of certain expectations, and preferring two tickets over one could be simply a manifestation of one such expectation.)  Ironically enough, when it comes to humans, I can't think of any ethical experiment that would be able to establish \"probabilistic thinking\" as a faculty that would be present even in the absence of any conditioning.  With animal subjects, however, it may be possible to set up experiments that minimize the possible confounding by conditioning.", "query_id": 746}

In this regard, I thought the most straightforward way to measure phase difference between two signals would be to compute the cross correlation function, and find the time $\\tau$ at which the cross correlation function reaches a maximum - call this Method 1. However, in practice what is usually done is to fourier transform the signals and measure phase difference of the complex fourier transform (and possibly average it over a frequency band of interest).

The central question for Turing was: how does a spherically symmetric embryo develop into a non-spherically symmetric organism under the action of symmetry-preserving chemical diffusion of morphogens (as Turing calls them, an abstract term for arbitrary molecules relevant to development)? The insight that Turing made is that very small stochastic fluctuations in the chemical distribution can be amplified by diffusion to produce stable (i.e. not time varying except slow increases in intensity; although also potentially time-varying with 3 or more morphogens) patterns that break the spherical symmetry.The theory is beautifully simple and abstract, and produces very important qualitative results (and also quantitative results through computer simulation, which unfortunately Turing did not get to fully explore). However, even in the definition Turing discusses some potential limitations such as ignoring mechanical factors, and the inability to explain preferences in handedness. The particular models he considers -- a cycle of discrete cells and a circular tissue -- do not seem particularly relevant. As far as I understand, the key feature is his observation of symmetry breaking through small stochastic noise and instability.

{"query": "Why do specifically bananas go brown quicker in the fridge?Perhaps the title should be: Why don't all fruits containing phenol residues go brown quickly when left in the fridge?Bananas go brown over time because of the oxidation of phenol residues. Bananas go brown quicker in the fridge than left at room temperature. This seems to contradict the first point since the reaction should be slower at colder temperatures. Dialogue from the naked scientists briefly explains why my line of thinking might be wrong.   Emily: Well it’s a good question and the answer is that they will  brown faster in the fridge.  It’s mainly due to the formation of ice  crystals, so if you put your banana in the fridge, the ice crystals  grow, and they actually rupture the cells of the banana skin. This  releases an enzyme called polyphenol oxidase and as the name suggests  it acts to oxygenate phenols, which have a ring-like structure, into  quinones, and these quinones can then all join together or polymerise  and produce a black, brown, or red pigment called polyphenol and this  is what gives it the brown colour. So, if you have your banana in the  fridge, this will occur and you'll get a brown banana.  But another  interesting thing about bananas is that if you have them in the fruit  bowl, they'll release ethene and this will make the other fruits in  the bowl ripen faster because it’s a ripening hormone.    Chris:   So, the question is though, if this is a chemical reaction  making this brown pigment, if you slow down the reaction by lowering  the temperature, then it should happen more slowly, therefore, going  in the fridge should make the bananas go black slower?    Emily:   I can see why you're thinking that but actually, it’s more  the rupturing of the cells.  So if you have a banana on your table,  the cells are going to be intact, the enzymes contained, and the  reaction is not happening at all whereas if you put in the fridge, the  enzyme is released and the reaction can happen – although yes, it  might happen slower.At the risk of channeling people into a yes or no answer, could someone clarify for me if the following statement is true maybe with a peer-reviewed source, which I've had no luck finding:   TLDR Bananas go brown quickly in the fridge because cell lysis, caused by ice crystal formation at cold temperatures in the fridge, releases Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) into the surrounding area which freely causes more browning.This leads me to another seeming paradox and the question I would like answered: Why doesn't this rapid browning in cool temperatures happen for other fruits and vegetables?

{"query": "Were there inns and hostels in medieval Europe?In fantasy novels or roleplaying games it is very common for the characters to stay a night at an inn, hostel or tavern. But I'm curious of what it was like for real in medieval times. I'm particularly interested in Britain, but any references to other parts of northern Europe are interesting as well, like France and Germany, or eastern Europe for that matter.I know that in Roman Britain they had, so called mansio that were run by the Roman government and meant for Roman officials, like tax collectors, to stay in on their travels to the far reaches of the Empire. Some of these even had bath houses.But what happened after the Romans left, and we enter the so called \"Dark Ages\"? During Anglo-Saxon times the feudal system started to rise with Jarls and Thegn, but how much freedom of travel did people have in this period, and was there any need for travel? Didn't most people have a farm to take care of and lived a mostly self-sufficient life? I guess there were markets and fairs now and then where they sold surplus produce (if any) and that required some amount of travel.In Norman times after 1066, weren't most villeins bound to their village in the Manor, and only a few freemen where allowed to leave the manor and travel? So how much need was there for inns and hostels and would there be enough travelers to make it a viable business? I suppose nobles had more liberty to travel, but would they settle for an inn in a village or would they rather stay at another noble's manor house or castle?Did this change later during the period? The middle ages spans almost 1000 years so I suppose a lot of things changed during this time? What about during the Plantagenet dynasty and the Tudor period?After the black death and the Peasants' Revolt in 1381 I can imagine that the travel ban was not so strictly enforced, and perhaps foreign trade had increase by now so that there were more merchants in the country, doing a lot more traveling.In the Mediterranean world hostels seemed more common; even the Bible mentions an inn in the Parable of the Good Samaritan, where a Samaritan takes a wounded traveller to an inn and leaves him there with a few coins for the innkeeper to take care of him.But the restriction on commoners by the feudal system in northern and eastern Europe seems to have made traveling more difficult and thus lodging a rather uneconomic business.

{"query": "What is the physical meaning of a Lie algebra symmetry?The physical meaning of a Lie group symmetry is clear: for example, if you have a quantum system whose states have values in some Hilbert space $H$, then a Lie group symmetry of the system means that $H$ is a representation of some Lie group $G$.  So you want to understand this Lie group $G$, and generally you do it by looking at its Lie algebra.  At least initially, this is understood as a way to make the problem of classifying Lie groups and their representations easier.But there are Lie algebras which are not the Lie algebra of a Lie group, and people are still interested in them.  One possible way to justify this perspective from a physical point of view is that Lie algebras might still be viewable as (\"infinitesimal\"?) symmetries of physical systems in some sense.

{"query": "Was frequent bathing for personal hygiene in medieval Europe common or not?The usual narrative: No bathingThere is a frequently debunked claim that medieval Europeans did not bathe. Occasionally, the claim is connected to pandemics of the era and extended to the idea that Aztecs may have burned incense around the conquistadors (they did that, this part is well-documented) to hide their unpleasant body odor.Arguments against the usual narrativeThe articles aiming to debunk the claim point to the existence of public baths and illustrations of these, medieval texts promoting bathing for health reasons, as well as the idea that outward cleanliness reflects the purity of the soul.Arguments in favor of the usual narrativeHowever, it appears that some medieval writers did show some hostility to bathing, including pope Boniface I (418-422) and that public baths were associated with prostitution and vanished at some point in parts of Europe. They may also have believed that bathing causes disease by allowing bad odors into the body through the pores (or so), but maybe this idea belongs more to the early modern period. (Erasmus seems to have written in 1526 that &quot;Twenty-five years ago, nothing was more fashionable in Brabant than the public baths. Today there are none, the new plague has taught us to avoid them.&quot;)ConfusionThe evidence we have on the topic seems to be contradictory; the same goes for the interpretation in the easily accessible accounts on the topic. Sometimes, the narrative seems to be that medieval hygiene was terrible and it got better with the Renaissance, sometimes the other way around. Some sources quote accounts of monks bathing 2-3 times a year as prohibition to bathe more often, others as evidence for ubiquity of bathing and hygiene. You can see how this is confusing. The switch from wool to linen clothing in early modern times may have played a role (cause since linen can easily be washed, there's no need for people to wash themselves, right?).QuestionThere is probably a fair bit of regional and intertemporal variety: Europe is huge and the Middle Ages span almost 1000 years (for the first several hundred, the evidence is probably quite sparse though). Nevertheless, there are probably some patterns. Was there a common trend in attitudes towards bathing, if not a uniform belief? Was there a time when attitudes changed? Were there persistent differences between certain regions? Can we at least say something about some region then? Or do we simply not know?Edit (Aug 18 2020):Thanks for the comments and replies so far. I can see that my list of questions was more confusing than helpful. I will try to explain more clearly:Is the question too broad? Should the question be narrowed down to one historic time and place (e.g., say, Subroman North Britain 6th century)? I am specifically not asking about some specific time and place. I am asking about the big picture. Did they bathe a lot less than regular pre-modern societies or is that a myth?Why should we care? If they did indeed bathe a lot less, then this would have had far-reaching implications for population dynamics, pandemics, health in Europe, pandemics in the Americas at the time of the Spanish takeover of the continent, as well as cultural perception of Europeans by non-Europeans. If this is, on the other hand, a myth, these implications are not only false, but it would say a lot about the later perception of the Middle Ages.The question how often St. Mungo bathed (@MAGolding) is also interesting, but not what I am interested in in this context. I apologize if I was not clear enough before.What type of reply do I hope for? One of the following plus details:Usual narrative is clearly a myth (they did not bathe significantly less than others)Usual narrative (no bathing) is clearly trueHistorical science does clealy not knowThere are clear historical, regional patterns (I.e., we can identify where they did indeed neglect bathing and hygiene.)There are very complicated historical, regional patterns that are too complicated to explain here. (I.e., there were where they did indeed neglect bathing and hygiene, but any patterns are very complicated or we are unable to make sense of them.)Some (@LarsBosteen, @MAGolding) allude to possibility 5: The true answer is too complex for the scope of a H:SE question. This would be disappointing. However, I am not convinced this is the case. As I understand it, the evidence we do have is very sparse. Asking the same question for any specific time and place in the 1000 years of the European Middle Ages would for almost all times and places lead to the assessment: We do not know and we have zero evidence. As a consequence, it should be possible to map out the evidence we do have and see if it yields a consistent pattern or story. While this would be clearly too much for a H:SE answer, I am hoping that given the prominence of this (medieval Europeans were stinky and did not bathe), some historians may already have published extensive research on this question. I am hoping that someone on H:SE may be aware of such research and give a brief summary.What about natural climatic effects? Winter bathing may have been more common in 10C weather in Sicily than in -25C weather in Finland. (@Lars Bosteen's hypothesis) Yes, I could imagine that this is true. But is it? Do we know? Also: Are there still other patterns? (Some sources specifically mention that compared to the rest of Europe, public bath houses may not have declined in Northern Europe, being combined with saunas instead.)What about the link between prostitution and bath houses? This may have creasted progressively more hostility towards bath houses (@gktscrk's hypothesis). Yes, that sounds plausible to me. But is it? Do we have evidence? Why would either prostitution in bath houses or hostility to prostitution become more prominent with time? If its just the church getting more and more outraged, should we perhaps see some evidence in religious texts? If prostitution in bath houses itself increased, then why: Was there some economic (more affluent customers?) or organizational (closure of other venues?) reason?", "query_id": 802}

Newman. (His definition is easy to use, allowing induction on the number of levels of a polygonal path, towards the proof of the Closed Curve Theorem, Ch.8.) It could be shown that this definition is equivalent to the usual ones, when restricted to connected open sets in the plane, link. (But not in $\\mathbb R^3$, where $D=\\mathbb R^3$ minus the $z$-axis is a counterexample.) Question 1. Who first defined simply connected ? Cauchy did a lot of work related to independence of an integral on the path of integration [see e.g. the book Cauchy and the Creation of Complex Function Theory, Frank Smithies, Cambridge Univ.Press, 1997], but it appears that he usually worked with simple closed curves, and paths inside their bounded component, without ever explicitly using the term, or the notion, of a simply connected domain. On the other hand in the book [History of Topology, ed. I.M. James, North Holland, 2006] several authors discuss simple connectedness. In particular R. Vanden Eynde, p.73 (again, related to independence on the path of integration) indicates that Riemann (as in 1851) distinguished between simply connected and multiply connected surfaces, citing: This leads to a distinction between simply connected surfaces, in which any closedcurve is the boundary of a part of the surface - like for instance a circle - and multiplyconnected surfaces, for which this property is not valid, - like for instance the surfacebounded by two concentric circles. Question 2. Was it Riemann who first defined simply connected? Did Cauchy ever consider this notion explicitly? Did anyone between Cauchy and Riemann consider it (or even earlier, though this seems unlikely), any references? Nowadays there are several equivalent definitions, they appear to have come later, which might perhaps be the subject of another discussion. Any help is greatly appreciated (either on the questions stated above, or any comments on various equivalent definitions known). Edit. As user46855 commented, it depends on your definition of a ``definition of simply connected''. There are many equivalent definitions and, although I would be very happy to receive some information about more recent ones (that is, around and after 1900's), I am mostly interested in the first definition, in whatever terms it was given. At those times many terms might have been fluid, e.g. even though I said above that Cauchy worked with simple closed curves (in 1814-1831), Jordan's theorem only came at the end of that century. So perhaps at those times there was no strict definition, but at any rate someone must have stated something in specific enough terms, so we would know they meant simply connected. User46855, thank you for the J.C.Pont reference, will try to find it. Edit March 20, 2017. The paper that motivated me to ask the above question was recently published in the American Mathematical Monthly. My coauthor and I adopted Poincare's work as reference to the (modern) definition of \"simply connected\", though we also indicate that some earlier work was done by Riemann (and Gauss), and refer to Pont's book (given in a comment and an answer below).

As far as I know, the primary response involves the non-specific response followed by the specific response, where APCs cause the activation of T cells resulting in clonal selection and expansion of T and B cells. The B cells then differentiate into plasma cells and produce antibodies. It results in the memory cells being produced, which can quickly reengage the specific response the next time the pathogen enters.Why doesn't the body just make memory cells to begin with? As if it has already encountered every possible pathogen. I presume it is just a lack of specificity in the A level teaching, but I am curious to know what I am missing here.Thanks,Jamie", "query_id": 814}

These 7 species are the last remaining in the family Hominidae.All the other hominids besides Homo sapiens died out tens of thousands of years ago, and we believe the reason our ancestors survived is because we were more \"adaptable\", meaning we were not restricted to a single environment but could survive in many others. This is the reason we later spread out all over the world, and probably why we gained \"sapience\" and are able to contemplate these grim circumstances.At one point, following the eruption of the Toba volcano 70,000 years ago, there were between 1,000 and 10,000 mating pairs of Homo sapiens left, though there may have been other hominid species alive at the time.

Possible answers I have come up with were, Sextus was not yet that powerful and Caesar possibly underestimated how influential he would become, but I think even this is not a full answer.  Caesar had obviously seen what Pompey's children were capable of in Africa and Hispania, where he only narrowly avoided defeat.  Additionally, he had seen just how powerful the Pompey name was in recruiting soldiers and allies (especially in the areas like Hispania where Pompey had his power bases.) Because of these reasons, Sextus eventually became a major problem for Augustus. It seems foolish for Caesar to depart for Parthia while he still had Sextus on his flank running around free.

Also, this Economist article shows a graph of the Mean Height of Men (source: Hatton &amp; Gray, 2010) with very similar figures to Hatton et al.Between 1880 and 1900, the size of the British (regular) Army increased from 165,000 to 275,000. Might not this significant increase in recruitment explain why the minimum height for recruits was lowered? Also, the Cardwell reforms Army Enlistment Act of 1870 reduced the normal period of service from 21 years to 12 years.On the issue of nutrition, Professor Anthony S. Wohl's article What the Poor Ate would seem to contradict Clayton &amp; Rowbotham:  It was not until the last quarter of the century that the working  man's diet improved significantly. Between 1877 and 1889 the cost of  the average national weekly food basket of butter, bread, tea, milk  and meat fell by some 30 per cent, and it was in this period that the  first really appreciable nutritional improvement (aided by a greater  variety of foods and new methods of retailing), occurred.Did the average height of men in late Victorian England decline due to poor nutrition?

{"query": "Have any mutations or genetic loci been associated with exceptional longevity in humans?Individuals that avoid age-related diseases into later life are known as 'exceptional survivors', and have increased longevity compared to their 'controls' (those that were born at a similar time, yet have 'aged' and died sooner). The Leiden Study determined that in these long-lived individuals there is a considerable genetic component contributing to the survival [Schoenmaker et al] (although this could equally be epigenetic - or even more likely, a combination of both).I have read about studies that have identified genetic mutations that cause premature aging phenotypes (for instance mutations in the WRN gene cause Werner's Syndrome [Yu et al]).I have yet to discover any studies that determine any associated with resistance to age-related disease (i.e. those that age 'well'). My question is whether anyone knows of any such studies?Arguably studies that have looked into predisposition to age-related diseases have found some mutations - for instance mutations within the 9p21 genetic locus (i.e. have been associated with heart disease and stroke independently (2 age-related diseases) [Wahlstrand et al]. Therefore individuals without any of these risk-increasing alleles could be considered predisposed to exceptional survival - but I see this as separate to my question. Are there any protective that increase 'global' survival? Are there a few protective alleles, or many with small effects? Or are the exceptional survivors just without any alleles?I am interested in published research (of course), but also in peoples general perceptions of the topic; there are plenty of theories of aging and longevity, but few facts - so please state what you 'believe', and explain why this is the case.Thanks for your time.p.s. I am aware that you can genetically modify lab models (e.g. C. elegans eat-2 mutants [Lakowski et al]) to live longer. I am interested in naturally occurring variants, specifically in humans (or that at least relate to human aging).Update (11 May 2012)I have found a study, published earlier this year, that finds a single genetic polymorphism to be associated (after correction for multiple testing) with centenarians [Sebastiani et al]. The SNP is in (in LD), which is certainly interesting given the previous links between APOE and Alzheimer's (an age-related disease). However, I am not convinced by the experimental design; they use age-at-death in centenarians as their cases (having genotyped them), and they use alive population controls as the controls. Whilst there is unlikely all these individual will become long-lived, a better design (to gain more power) would have been to use individuals who have died from 'premature' (e.g. between 60 and 70) age-related disease.

{"query": "K-Theory and the Stack of Vector BundlesI have some understanding that vector bundles provide a basic, familiar example of what I should call a stack.  Namely, consider the functor $Vect$ that assigns to a space $X$ the set of isomorphism classes of vector bundles on $X$.  This functor isn't local, in the sense that the isoclass of a vector bundle isn't determined by its restriction to an open cover, but rather by gluing data on overlapping sets in a cover.  Since for any space $Y$ a map $X \\to Y$ is determined by what it does when restricted to a cover of $X$, this tells us there is no space $Y$ that represents the functor $Vect$ in this fashion.  However, I can also consider $Vect$ as a stack, which assigns to $X$ the groupoid of vector bundles on $X$.  This gadget is fancy enough to understand how vector bundles glue together, and so recovers the locality missing from our earlier functor.In K-theory, we attach to a space $X$ a ring $K(X)$ whose underlying group is the the free abelian group on the set of isoclasses of vector bundles on $X$, mod short exact sequences.  It turns out that one can describe $K(X)$ as the set of homotopy classes of maps from $X$ to $\\mathbb{Z} \\times BU(\\infty)$.At this point my meager understanding of K-theory seems to be contradict what I said in the first paragraph.  The fact that $K(X)$ has a classifying space seems at odds with the observation that vector bundles aren't determined by their restrictions to open covers, whereas maps to another space are.  Is something wrong with what I've said so far? If not, perhaps there isn't a contradiction because either 1) $K(X)$ isn't quite the set of isoclasses of vector bundles, but rather a group completion thereof, or 2) we're looking at homotopy classes of maps to $\\mathbb{Z} \\times BU(\\infty)$, so what I said in the first paragraph doesn't apply?", "query_id": 852}

Tolle describes the outcome of this practice as something along the lines of \"these emotions are transmuted into awareness\". I'm interested if there's any evidence in cognitive science to support his claim. The description reminds me of mirror neurons - observing an emotion in others \"infects\" the observer with the same emotion. There's a small number of deeply connected mirror neurons that permeate the human brainThis makes me ask the question - are there \"awareness\" related mirror neurons or similar structures that get activated by one's own awareness? By which process could the experience of observing emotion increase awareness of the observer? Update: this wikipedia article has a very brief section on mirror neurons and self awareness:  V.S. Ramachandran has speculated that mirror neurons may provide the  neurological basis of human self-awareness.[70] In an essay written  for the Edge Foundation in 2009 Ramachandran gave the following  explanation of his theory: \"...

And the Western leaders met with Stalin at Teheran, Yalta, and elsewhere to coordinate the various countries' activities? Late in the war, the western Allies and the Soviets met at Torgau, Germany.Was a similar level of cooperation undertaken by the Western Allies and Russia in World War I? The logical place for this was Turkey. During most of 1915 (and into early 1916, Britain and France attacked the Turks at {Gallipoli]2 in Northwest Turkey. Late in 1915, the Russians attacked northeast Turkey with over 300,000 men, capturing Erzurum (Turkish Armenia). In early 1916, they advanced to Trabizon, on the Black Sea, just as the Allies were leaving Gallipoli.Also of note is the fact that early in 1916, the British and Russians both invaded Iran in the Persian campaign, but could never seem to get to the same place at the same time.Were these actions part of an intended, if unsuccessful attempt at coordinating, or meeting the British by the Russians? I am puzzled by the fact that the Russians sent \"only\" tens of thousands of men toward the British forces moving north from southern Iran (and later southern Iraq), while the bulk of Russian Caucasus forces were in northern Turkey. Given that the Gallipoli campaign was unable to open up a transport route to Russia, would it have made sense to try for a connection through Iraq or Iran (the latter was the case in World War II)?

Eliot's essay on Hamlet, Peter Shor wrote,According to Aristotle, in great tragedy the hero must have a fatal flaw that leads to his downfall. What Eliot failed to recognize was that Hamlet's fatal flaws were intellectualism and indecisiveness (maybe because he saw these as positive character traits). The delay in revenge has no simple, rational explanation, because it's Hamlet's fatal flaw. If there had been a good reason for him to delay his revenge, the ending wouldn't be Aristotelean tragedy but just bad luck.This assumes that the theories exposed in Aristotle's Poetics were somehow relevant to Shakespeare's tragedies during the period in which they were written. However, as far as I know, Shakespeare did not consistently use a five-act division (the act and scene divisions we are used to seeing in modern editions are typically the work of later editors) and he disregarded the three unities in all of his plays except (more or less) The Tempest.This leads me to the question whether Shakespeare would have known Aristotle's Poetics.

From Medical News Today - COVID-19: How do viral vector vaccines work?:With all viral vectors, one issue to consider is pre-existing immunity.If a person encountered the virus that serves as the vector in the past, they may have antibodies to the virus. This means that their body will try to fight and destroy the viral vector, potentially making a vaccine less effective.But where is the innate immune system in all this?

{"query": "Is hastily writing down the professor&#39;s lecture a good way of learning?I am writing this from the perspective of a mathematician. I am wondering whether there is any research on the standard mode of instruction.Mathematics lectures, at least in my home country, typically work as follows: the prof starts writing on the blackboard (or whiteboard) while telling about the notes, and students copy down the notes from the board.90% of the lecturer's speech is reading out the notes aloud while facing the blackboard. Depending on the level interaction, there may of course be questions to the audience, but mainly it is reading out the lecture notes.Most students aren't really listening because they are busy copying down the notes from the board. You typically see them turning their back and forth between the board and their own notes. Students may find themselves in &quot;unintelligent copy&quot; mode, just copying symbols from the blackboard without any comprehension of meaning.Irrespective of your style of instruction, I think this is a terribly ineffective concept of teaching right from the start. Individuals have told me that they believe in some sort of &quot;subconscious diffusion&quot; of the lecture material into their students' minds, even if their students are just in &quot;unintelligent copy&quot; mode. I don't believe in this and find this rather counter-intuitive.All in all, much of the typical way of lecturing looks like a giant waste of time to me.

{"query": "How does the NAD+/NADH ratio affect lifespan in vertebrates?Here's the proximate physical implication of the ratio (from the Wikipedia article on NADH).  The balance between the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide  adenine dinucleotide is called the ratio. This ratio is an  important component of what is called the redox state of a cell, a  measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health  of cells. The effects of the ratio are complex,  controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase.  In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio between free NAD+  and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the ratio is thus  favourable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total  is much lower, with estimates ranging from 0.05 to 4. In  contrast, the ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is  the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key  to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH.So here's my question: how does this manifest in vertebrate aging?

Perhaps I'm naïve.Is there any research on the question: how common is academic theft, really?

{"query": "Detect patterns in sequences of actionsI have to analyse sequences of actions that look more or less like this JSON blob. The question I'm trying to answer is whether there are recurring (sub)patterns that different users adopt when asked to perform a certain specific task -- in this case, the task is to build a mathematical formula using this editor. In particular I'd like to know if there are multiple significantly different ways in which people build the same expression.I thought of creating a Markov model, but that would only give me the most likely sequence of actions of length N. An obvious alternative would be to build trees and count how many times a certain path occurs in the dataset. However, the nature of the expression-building process means that the sequences can be polluted by many confounding, non-significant actions (such as streaks of UNDO-REDO, deleting symbols, and the likes).I might go the \"longest common subsequence\" route, but I'm not sure that would tell me if there are \"significantly different\" ways of building the same expression (in quotes because, for now, I don't have a rigorous definition of \"significantly different\", but, for example, one way would be to drag and drop-in-place all the symbols in the correct order, and another way would be to drag all the symbols onto the canvas, and then place them in the correct spots).I thought this might be a nice challenge for some AI algorithm, but I'm quite a noob at that, so I'm open to suggestions.", "query_id": 932}

{"query": "Nature vs. NurtureIn the following I have 4 questions which I think are too interleaved to separate into 4 different posts. I hope it's not a duplicate, but I didn't find here similar posts.My understanding (as a layman, based on few non-professional books and some googling) is that the current \"state of the art\" regrading the age-old question in the title, is essentially as following: For pretty much any reliable measurement researchers could come up with (in relation to cognitive capabilities, personality traits, interests, confidence, success, etc), 100% of the variance could be attributed to heredity and nonshared-environment (typically in approximately 50-50 split between the two), and effectively 0% of the variance is attributed to shared-environment.My impression is that the research is vast, the data is ample, and the conclusions are overwhelmingly consistent and accepted.My first intermediate question: is the above description correct? Now, that trichotomy, as I understand it, goes like this: by \"heredity\" people refer to anything identical twins that grow separately share (so mainly genetic and epigenetic factors), by \"nonshared-environment\" people refer to anything identical twins that grow together do not share (specific social interactions, different life experience, etc), and by \"shared environment\" people refer to the things non-sibling that grow together share (same parents and family, same home, same neighborhood, same school, same lifestyle etc).My second intermediate question: is this description correct?If so, it basically means that a pair of identical twins that grew up together, is indistinguishable from a pair of identical twins that grew up separately, and that a pair of any two random people is indistinguishable from any two non-sibling that grew up in the same home with the same parents.In shorts, sharing home does not make people more similar, with respect to most reliably measurable properties.My third intermediate question: are there any notable exceptions? Known traits whose variance is meaningfully explained by the shared-environment?My forth and last question: Is the socioeconomic status of the family is part of the shared-environment? It seems as it should be (if my description above is not too-wrong), but then it implies that it has no effect on anything other than the future socioeconomic status of the children.

The loss function is used to update the neural network using gradient descent.Experience replay is used, which basically creates a buffer of experiences. This buffer of experiences is randomly sampled and these random samples are used to update the non-frozen neural network.My question pertains to the DQN algorithm illustrated in the paper: Algorithm 1, more specifically lines 4 and 9 of this algorithm.

I want to know, since the input is given to a CNN, how would we encode these frames to serve as input to the CNN?

By &quot;taken seriously,&quot; I mean that this paper would not be significantly disadvantaged; that is, a typical researcher would assume that this paper is roughly comparable to similar papers in a peer-reviewed journal.Many academics view peer review as currently practiced as indicating credibility of the work. I completed a PhD last year and currently work in a non-research job. I am working on a few papers on the side. I have published peer-reviewed journal articles and reviewed some articles before, but I find the review process to be typically superficial and slow. I barely have the time to do the research in the first place, much less time to format the paper to the journal style, respond to reviewers, etc. I also would like to publish open-access but can not afford the fees.

{"query": "Can A Lazy Person Complete a Statistics PhD? (and other questions)I'm about to graduate with my BS and begin a PhD program in statistics. However, I have some doubts about my ability to succeed just because everyone says that a PhD is a grueling, long journey and that work ethic is more important than just being smart. I think my motives for doing the degree are fine -- I don't intend on trying to join academia and I want to do the degree because I find the field powerful and because I want access to the research roles in industry that are generally more interesting. I'm young, have no debt, and my program is fully-funded so I think that helps the opportunity cost aspect, although there is always what me and my friends joke about as the &quot;opportunity cost of not becoming a software engineer.&quot;However, throughout college and my education thus far, I feel like I have been extremely lazy. One of the reasons why I enjoyed studying math and statistics on a structural level in terms of college major was that the courses generally had two or three grades; midterm, final, and sometimes graded homework. So pretty much since my grade depended only on those things I would just study like one day in advance of each exam and forget about the course entirely in between. I don't think I've studied for a single exam more than a day in advance in my entire four years. Also, unless a class had mandatory attendance (nearly all of the classes did not) I would ditch it. I would rather just read out of the textbook myself and I can't listen to people teach math to me because the speed of my thoughts does not match the speed of how people talk. Overall, I think I have a realistic view of my abilities though. I'm not a genius or anything, just lazy, so I calculate exactly how lazy I can be and then I be that lazy. Of course, for something like qualifying exams I recognize I would not be able to do that and would take more time.I also enjoy smoking weed, and I am a daily smoker. I feel like I have a different view than other people in this field traditionally: I'd rather just chill, hang out with my friends, and enjoy life. However, this is not to say that I have no interest in statistics. I have an enormous appreciation for the elegance of statistical theory and I've done a lot of interdisciplinary research using applications of statistics. I love doing research thus far and always felt motivated to work on projects etc. and in fact we have a paper accepted at a conference and my PI has found funding to pay me this summer to hopefully push out one or two more papers. I go out of my way to participate in research and for the last year I've been working in two different groups at once. I just really am quite lazy with school and I see the point of it but it is simply easier and more efficient for me to read out of the textbook, especially since this field is a mathematical one.Based on my context, I had two questions:(1) What happens to lazy statistics PhD students like me?(2) So far in my undergraduate curriculum we have only been learning theories and concepts that have already been developed, and not developing anything new. Probability theory classes and real analysis were probably the most difficult parts, but it was not doing anything novel. The rest of the stats electives like methods at the level of the courses taught were pretty much just trivial plug-and-chug type material. Since PhD students would be creating novel ideas in statistics (maybe like new methods is what stands out to me), how do they make this jump from &quot;plug-and-chug&quot; to doing this type of original work? How well-defined are research problems in statistics (in the sense that there are straightforward paths to approach well-known problems vs. the necessity of having some Einstein idea and needing that fundamental creativity to even generate a research question)?

In addition, a \"listening\" machine is calibrated to process the sounds emanating from the vocal chords.

These sentences caught my attention:Separate treatment of the two types of waste is justified since urine is nearly sterile and low in pathogens, provided an individual is healthy.[3] This means that urine can be readily utilized as a fertilizer or discharged with less risk to community.[4]Human feces, on the other hand are high in pathogens, including up to 120 viruses and need to be treated well before it can be safely used in agriculture. Urine diversion - principle (Wikipedia article)So urine is nearly sterile and low in pathogens, however it qualifies that statement with the condition that the person producing that urine is healthy. I assume when they compare this to feces they do so with all other things being equal (ie., provided an individual is healthy).It claims that there may be up to 120 viruses in feces, as opposed to urine which it characterizes as being relatively low risk. I assume that feces are riskier in transmission of diseases because it naturally contains more pathogens, but it doesn't explain what these viruses or pathogens are.

During the first semester of my second year, I spent about 3-4 hours a week on research while taking three classes and got very little done research-wise.I usually have about 8 hours of office hours a week for TA (some of which are for review or practice sessions) and I also type LaTeX notes for students which I improve each semester.I want to be a lecturer or community college math instructor (I am aware that their job security is not ideal, but I would rather have a job that I enjoy than being a professor, because I definitely do not want to continue research after I graduate with my Ph.D.) It seems like for those positions completing a Ph.D. is needed to be a competitive job candidate, but the quality of the research doesn't really matter. Being more likely to get a job is the only reason I am doing my Ph.D.I have gotten 6 A's and 3 A+'s in the 9 classes I have taken for my Ph.D. so far, because I spend enough on them and also tutor other graduate students in some of the classes I am taking with makes me spend even more time. I like how for classes I learn everything by going to lectures instead of having to read references, have a large number of small homework problems instead of a small number of difficult research problems, and taking tests instead of working on long-term projects.During my second year the main reason I don't do much research-wise is that I spend too much time TAing and tutoring, but starting in my third year it will be more so motivation than time, because I won't be taking classes. I was supposed to read a lot over winter break and also complete a proof and didn't have any other responsibilities. I read what I was supposed to and typed about 40 pages of LaTeX notes, but I skipped all of the proofs in the book and I found that after I finished reading I did not remember most of the notes I had typed, because I typed them quickly and didn't read the text deeply. I also didn't do the proof. I had a lot of time during break, but I chose not to do a good job because I wasn't motivated.How can I determine whether I am doing enough each week to complete my Ph.D. and not be kicked out for not doing enough research? I usually don't finish the weekly assignments I get, but my advisor hasn't mentioned that I am not doing enough. I know that one way to find out is to ask my advisor, but I don't want them to know that I just want to complete the Ph.D. And I don't want to spend time on research, because then they might decide that they don't want to work with me anymore and I wouldn't be able to finish my Ph.D.I think that I probably wouldn't spend more than 12 hours weekly during my last three years on research, but I would spend at least 8 hours weekly even if less than that was enough. I know that this would leave me with a significant amount of free time which I would probably spend tutoring undergraduate and graduate students, because I am motivated to do that and it would help improve my teaching skills.In summaryIs 12 hours spent weekly on research for the final 3 years enough to complete a minimal Ph.D. for a slightly above average Ph.D. student?Is there a way that I can continually check whether I am on track to complete my Ph.D. and not be kicked out for making unsatisfactory progress?", "query_id": 999}

Fitness of cells relative to other cells in the body is reduced, but fitness of the genome as a whole of that individual is increased relative to other individuals of that population -as a result of cancer-directed apoptosis.Reverse Example (trait whose absence benefits the group)Organism: Cervus elaphus, Red DeerUnit: Individual red deer and their genomesGroup: Isolated population of red deer and the population gene poolGroup-selected trait: Lethal potential of antlers (e.g. sharp single antler instead of two blunt antlers).Explanation: Consider a one-antlered stag, whose single antler is imbued with a jagged edge and is the product of a point mutation in his genome. During a rut he is able to win against other males as his antler inflicts potentially fatal injuries. This allows him to mate many females and have many offspring - however this leaves the population at risk of becoming extinct since the mating season would either have too few males to form a rut, or due to deleterious inbreeding defects in the next generation.LinksWiki: Review: course do not feel restrained in your answers by the above suggestions - the point is to discuss the topic and learn!", "query_id": 1015}

(Such traits could include gene duplication; body plans that can easily be adapted to new niches; learning (which enhances evolution due to the Baldwin effect) and so on. Questions about the evolution of such traits are collectively termed \"evolution of evolvability.\") The term \"lineage selection\" does not refer to group selection or kin selection, but simply to selection between distinct genetic lineages in a mixed population.What I would like to know is whether a mathematical theory has been developed along the lines of the Price equation that can capture the concept of lineage selection and make predictions about it. Lineage selection does not appear to be modelled by the Price equation itself, at least not in a straightforward and obvious way, because on the face of it the Price equation only directly accounts for the relation between a trait and the number of offspring in the next generation, rather than the number of surviving descendants several generations later, which is what is required for lineage selection.The reason I'm looking for a mathematical model is that there are a number of intuitions that many people seem to share about lineage selection and I'd like to understand what assumptions are needed in order for them to be true. In particular, it seems clear that large populations are needed for lineage selection to be effective, and I'd like to understand precisely the relationship between population size and the effectiveness of lineage selection. (My intuition is that with a population size of around a million, lineage selection can select for traits that have a beneficial effect around 20 generations later, since $1,000,000\\approx 2^{20}$, but this intuition lacks a formal basis.)A literature search did not turn up anything along the lines of what I'm looking for, but this is not my main field and I may simply not know the most appropriate search terms to use.", "query_id": 1037}

I have found that some of the population dynamics literature is very relevant to my own work, but I am not very familiar with the vast biology and ecology literatures on this topic. I have been reading Murray's Mathematical Biology volume 1 bible, and it is really great--but it only gives a taste of the models out there.I was hoping someone could help point me towards articles or models that deal with multi-generational evolution of a population with time delays. I have having a little trouble deciphering some of the biology or ecology terminology, so I am not sure if my search terms are correct--I have not been able to find anything like this, though I am certain it exists.I am looking at a very simple model, something on the order of a system of differential equations with delays. So a simplified examples is below with just one species that matures over time. So for the same species, there are 3 populations, A, B, C, which represent stages in its lifecycle. I can refer to these in the model as $N_A, N_B, N_C$. Then there is a birth and death rate for each population, as well as a migration rate between the different populations--as individuals mature. I am thinking of the populations in continuous time, though of course suggestions for articles about discrete dynamics for such systems would also be valuable.So the continuous system would be as below:$$\\frac{dN_A}{dt} = \\beta N_C - \\gamma_A N_A - \\nu_A N_A(t - \\tau_A) \\\\\\frac{dN_B}{dt} = \\nu_A N_A(t - \\tau_A) - \\gamma_B N_B - \\nu_B N_B(t - \\tau_B) \\\\\\frac{dN_C}{dt} = \\nu_B N_B(t - \\tau_B) - \\gamma_C N_C \\\\$$So constants $\\beta, \\gamma, \\nu, \\tau$ represent constants for the birth rate, death rate, migration-maturation rate, and time lag. In my actual model I have 2 species that compete, but this model above gives a flavor of the dynamics. I would like to include some carrying capacity constraints too, but that can come later.Like I said, it is easy enough to express this model in a discrete form as well. But I was hoping someone might be able to reference articles or something that shows someone analyzing discete multi-generational models--so that I can see a flavor of how they deal with the nondimensionalization, bifurcations, chaotic dynamics, etc.I was hoping to see if other biologists or ecologists had studied this kind of continuous system, and how they had analyzed it.

I've never been to one - maybe they are amazing? - but I am wondering why so many studio comedies (with what are arguably A-list actors) have the restaurant featured.  Maybe I am just imagining a connection, but off the top of my head I can think of \"Talladega Nights\", Vince Vaughn's speech in \"Couple's Retreat\", \"Hall Pass\" and most recently \"Why Him?\"  Is there an in-joke I am missing that only Applebee's patrons are in on?  Is there a marketing deal with a particular production group or some other common thread between the films? (e.g. are they all 20th Century Fox films?)  Why Applebee's as opposed to Olive Garden, T.G.I.Friday's, Ruby Tuesday, Outback Steakhouse, Sizzler's, Benihana's or some other national chain?  Is it just because they are a fairly ubiquitous national chain, and essentially like using Budweiser if an American character is a non-discriminating beer drinker? Also, like Les Grossman drinking a Diet Coke, the particular product does say something about the characters that use the product. Why Applebee's in particular?  Or, is there a more mundane reason on the production deal end explaining why Applebee's in particular? Something like, for example, if Ben Stiller were an executive producer on all the films and he were a part owner of AppleBee's, or maybe there is some other less fiscal angle which is a common thread to all the movies which feature Applebee's? I appreciate how marketing works for the advertiser and the payment made for the ad time. If it were all the same &amp; moviemakers \"don't care\" which product so long as they pay the most for the ad time, then why so many movies using Applebee's? If the market strategy were so effective, why aren't other chains competing for that ad space? Why the market share of advertising time for Applebee's as opposed to any other chain (or, simply making up a chain like Chotchkie's or Shenanigan's)?", "query_id": 1054}

{"query": "Graph for relationship between two ordinal variablesWhat is an appropriate graph to illustrate the relationship between two ordinal variables?A few options I can think of:Scatter plot with added random jitter to stop points hiding each other. Apparently a standard graphic - Minitab calls this an \"individual values plot\". In my opinion it may be misleading as it visually encourages a kind of linear interpolation between ordinal levels, as if the data were from an interval scale.Scatter plot adapted so that size (area) of point represents frequency of that combination of levels, rather than drawing one point for each sampling unit. I have occasionally seen such plots in practice. They can be hard to read, but the points lie on a regularly-spaced lattice which somewhat overcomes the criticism of the jittered scatter plot that it visually \"intervalises\" the data.Particularly if one of the variables is treated as dependent, a box plot grouped by the levels of the independent variable. Likely to look terrible if the number of levels of the dependent variable is not sufficiently high (very \"flat\" with missing whiskers or even worse collapsed quartiles which makes visual identification of median impossible), but at least draws attention to median and quartiles which are relevant descriptive statistics for an ordinal variable.Table of values or blank grid of cells with heat map to indicate frequency. Visually different but conceptually similar to the scatter plot with point area showing frequency.Are there other ideas, or thoughts on which plots are preferable?

To the best of my understanding a reflex is defined by the use of neurons to convey the information, I'm just wondering if there are any grey areas which don't qualify as a reflex but may be faster.

There are reports of synthetic such structures; see this paper, for example. However, my question is: are there functional examples of parallel DNA double helices? Here are some criteria:It should be double stranded. This excludes structures such as G-quadraplexes, which do have some parallel strands.It does not have to be an extended helix. I don't have any specific length restrictions, but don't assume it needs to be hundreds or even tens of base pairs long.The structure need not be solely composed of DNA. If a parallel helix is induced by, say, protein or small molecule binding, so be it.By \"functional examples\", I mean that the parallel structure should have some effect on cellular processes. The structure can be studied in vitro, even using synthetic constructs, but it should have some functional significance in vivo (or, at least a proposed significance).Note that although I only mention DNA above, papers discussing parallel RNA double helices in the same spirit would also be welcome.Related question: why is DNA antiparallel?

{"query": "Are we exaggerating importance of model assumption and evaluation in an era when analyses are often carried out by laymenBottom line, the more I learn about statistics, the less I trust published papers in my field; I simply believe that researchers are not doing their statistics well enough.I'm a layman, so to speak. I'm trained in biology but I have no formal education in statistics or mathematics. I enjoy R and often make an effort to read (and understand...) some of the theoretical foundations of the methods that I apply when doing research. It wouldn't surprise me if the majority of people doing analyses today are actually not formally trained. I've published around 20 original papers, some of which have been accepted by recognized journals and statisticians have frequently been involved in the review-process. My analyses commonly include survival analysis, linear regression, logistic regression, mixed models. Never ever has a reviewer asked about model assumptions, fit or evaluation.Thus, I never really bothered too much about model assumptions, fit and evaluation. I start with a hypothesis, execute the regression and then present the results. In some instances I made an effort to evaluate these things, but I always ended up with \"well it didn't fulfill all assumptions, but I trust the results (\"subject matter knowledge\") and they are plausible, so it's fine\" and when consulting a statistician they always seemed to agree.Now, I've spoken to other statisticians and non-statisticians (chemists, physicians and biologists) who perform analyses themselves; it seems that people don't really bother too much about all these assumptions and formal evaluations. But here on CV, there is an abundance of people asking about residuals, model fit, ways to evaluate it, eigenvalues, vectors and the list goes on. Let me put it this way, when lme4 warns about large eigenvalues, I really doubt that many of its users care to address that...Is it worth the extra effort? Is it not likely that the majority of all published results do not respect these assumptions and perhaps have not even assessed them?

I asked a well-respected professor who said she did not know this area well enough. Now Valkee guided me to the publications such as Penetration of light into the brain of mammals (1963) and Spectral characteristics of visible radiation penetrating into the brain and stimulating extraretinal photoreceptors (1979). Related to the first one, I found this (1980) from the references:  \"It  is  now  fully  accepted that  the  perception  of  light  by  extraocular  photoreceptors  plays  a  significant  role  in  synchronizing  endogenous  rhythms  with  the  environmental  light-dark cycle  in  non-mammalian  vertebrates\"Things such as certain birds and lizards apparently have extraretinal photoreception aka photosensitive cells not in eyes (this is how I understand it).

My professor in system sciences was extremely scornful when I even asked this question on a seminar course about brain -- he did not specify his reasons and pretty much labelled my thinking as inexperience. Now I am not sure whether researchers are even speaking about the same issues: too large disparities between opposing and proposing teams for the assumed effect apparently through the mechanism called \"extraretinal photoreception in mammals\". I am very curious. Helper questions    What are the mechanisms by which a led in ear would affect a mammal such as a homo sapiens? You don't get D vitamin because of no UV light. You get very-very light heat because of tosslink connection. So it cannot sense the heat as antidote against things such as SAD and jetlag. Other mechanism?  Is the \"extraretinal photoreception in mammals\" just placebo or does there exist scientific proofs for it particularly with large mammals about the size of homo sapiens?   Why would evolution have lead to extraretinal photoreception in mammals?  Do the terms \"extraretinal photoreception\" and \"non-eye photosensitive cells\" mean the same thing? Other terms for the same thing?  Now eyes are developed very late in cell-division with mammals. Do born-blind mammals and later-blinded mammals experience extraretinal photoreception differently? If led-light (non-UV light) has an effect on large mammals, then I expect this may be possible to see by analyzing results of mammals with different-developed visual-cortexes.   Does this statement \"Light penetrates deep brain areas, eye's receptors have developed from receptors of old CNS.\" by Humancharger justify the extraretinal photorecetpion?  P.s.

Many aqueducts in Rome's former empire were kept in good repair. The 15th-century rebuilding of an aqueduct at Segovia in Spain shows advances on the Pont du Gard by using fewer arches of greater height, and so greater economy in its use of the raw materials.

Based on a rejection algorithm, $x_i$ is either retained or rejected. The list of retained $x_i$s made the posterior distribution.Markov Chain Monte CarloMCMC consists at sampling a prior distribution of the parameter $\\theta$. It takes a first sample $\\theta_1$, compute $P(x_{obs} | \\theta_1)P(\\theta_1)$ and then jump (according to some rule) to a new value $\\theta_2$ for which $P(x_{obs} | \\theta_2)P(\\theta_2)$ is computed again. The ratio $\\frac{P(x_{obs} | \\theta_2)P(\\theta_2)}{P(x_{obs} | \\theta_1)P(\\theta_1)}$ is calculated and depending on some threshold value, the next jump will occur from the first or the second position. The exploration of $\\theta$ values goes one and one and by the end, the distribution of retained $\\theta$ values is the posterior distribution $P(\\theta | x)$ (for a reason that is still unknown to me).I realize that my explanations miss to represent the variety of methods that exists under each of these terms (especially for MCMC).ABC vs MCMC (pros and cons) ABC has the advantage that one does not need to be able to analytically solve $P(x | \\theta)P(\\theta)$.

It was the person’s fear, anxiety, or even knowledge of the disease itself which manifested the symptoms rather than the action of a non-living obligate parasite.

Beyond this philosophical question, it also raises practical statistical questions about the appropriate treatment of a time index in a DAG.

{"query": "Proof of optimality for CHSH game classical strategyI'm aware that the optimality of the quantum strategy for the CHSH game is given by Tsirelson's bound, but presentations all skip over the (admittedly much less interesting) proof of the classical strategy's optimality.In the CHSH game, we have two players: Alice and Bob. They are separately given independent random bits $X$ and $Y$ as input, and without communication must output bits of their own ($A$ and $B$) with the goal of making true the logical formula $X \\cdot Y = A \\oplus B$. The claimed optimal classical strategy is for Alice and Bob to both always output $0$, which results in a win 75% of the time:$\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\\hlineX &amp; Y &amp; A &amp; B &amp; X \\cdot Y &amp; A \\oplus B \\\\ \\hline0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\hline0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\hline1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\hline1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\hline\\end{array}$The quantum strategy (which I go over here) results in a win ~85% of the time. You can use this in a proof of the insufficiency of local hidden variables to explain entanglement as follows:Assume qbits decide at time of entanglement how they will collapse (rather than at time of measurement); this means they must carry with them some information (the local hidden variable), and this information can be written as a string of bits.Since the information is sufficient to completely describe the way in which the entangled qbits collapse, Alice and Bob could, if given access to that same string of classical bits, simulate the behavior of a shared pair of entangled qbits.If Alice and Bob could simulate the behavior of a shared pair of entangled qbits, they could implement the quantum strategy with local classical methods using the pre-shared string of classical bits. Thus, there must exist some classical strategy giving an 85% success rate with some string of bits as input.However, there exists no string of bits which enables a classical strategy with success rate above 75%.By contradiction, the behavior of entangled particles is not reducible to a string of bits (local hidden variable) and thus the entangled particles must instantaneously affect one another at time of measurement.I'm interested in the proof of (4). I imagine this proof takes the form of a noncommunicative pair of Turing machines which take as input independent random bits $X$ and $Y$ plus an arbitrary shared bitstring, which then win the CHSH game with probability greater than 75%; presumably this results in some contradiction demonstrating the nonexistence of such TMs. So what is this proof?Secondarily, which papers have presented a proof of the classical strategy's optimality?Bonus question: in (1), we claim that the local hidden variable can be written as a string of bits; is there a simple reason why this is the case?", "query_id": 1195}

Yet is promoted as being &quot;Healthy&quot;Poor grammar issues etc. aside, I thought I would try and look into this.According to WebMDCanthaxanthin is used to reduce sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity) experienced by people who have a rare genetic disease called erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). In these people, sunlight can cause skin reactions such as rash, itch, and eczema. Canthaxanthin is also used to reduce sun sensitivity caused by certain medications and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.In the side effects tab, it does sayWhen taken by mouth: Canthaxanthin is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth in food amounts. However, it is LIKELY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in amounts needed for artificial tanning. Some people who have taken canthaxanthin for these purposes have experienced eye damage and vision loss.Could Captain Paul Watson be skewing this information?  Is using Canthaxanthin in Salmon farming highly toxic to humans and damaging to human eye health?", "query_id": 1204}

{"query": "How would a Quantum Computer (network) perform loophole-free Bell tests?In a simple form, Bell's theorem states that:  No physical theory of local hidden variables can ever reproduce all of the predictions of quantum mechanics.Bell developed a series of inequalities to provide specific experimental examples to distinguish between the predictions of any theory relying on local hidden variables and those of quantum mechanics. As such, Bell test inequality experiments are of fundamental interest in quantum mechanics. However, if one wants to do things properly, one realizes that there are a number of loopholes that affects, in different degrees, all experiments trying to perform Bell tests.[1] Experiments trying to close these loopholes tend to be unique rather than routine. One of the results of having general-purpose quantum computers, or networks thereof, would be the ability to routinely perform sophisticated quantum experiments.Question: What requirements would have to fulfill a general-purpose quantum computer (network) to be able to implement Bell tests that are at least as loophole-free as the best realization that has been done so far?For clarity: ideally the best answer will take a quantum computing approach and contain close-to-engineering details, or at least close-to-architecture. For example, writing the experiment as a simple quantum circuit, one of the current architectures can be chosen and from that one would make some realistic order-of-magnitude estimates to the required times of the different quantum gates measurements and of the required physical distance between the different qubits.[1] As commented by @kludg, it has been argued that \"..no experiment, as ideal as it is, can be said to be totally loophole-free.\", see Viewpoint: Closing the Door on Einstein and Bohr’s Quantum Debate", "query_id": 1214}

{"query": "What is the biology behind human population dynamics?A paradox: Human population growth looks a lot like a simple logistic growth pattern. But the simplest interpretation of logistic growth doesn't seem to fit. Is this peculiar to humans, or does it have a biological explanation?Ecologically, advances in agriculture over the last ~200 years have increased the Earth's carrying capacity for human population, and the human population appears to have grown and started flattening out as we approach the new carrying capacity -- this basically looks like logistic growth (following a change in the carrying-capacity parameter).The simplest biological interpretation of logistic growth is that birth rates remain constant (driven by constant biological factors), but as the population approaches the carrying capacity, there are not enough resources to go around, so death rates rise to match the birth rate. In human populations, this rise in death rates would presumably manifest itself in the form of widespread famine and resource wars.But that is not at all what we see in the human population! In fact, we have seen falling death rates due to advances in medicine. For some reason, birth rates have actually fallen to levels roughly commensurate with the death rates (and in most developed countries, the drop in birth rates has actually overcompensated for the drop in death rates, leading to an ageing population). So although the net population dynamics seem relatively simple, the simplest explanation for these dynamics fails spectacularly. This leads to severalQuestions:Is there an underlying biological mechanism linking our approach toward the environment's carrying capacity to a resulting drop in birth rates?There are compelling sociological explanations -- education and empowerment of women, urbanization, decreased child mortality, access to contraception, etc. all point individuals toward a reproductive strategy of investing more into a smaller number of children. But from a sociological perspective, it appears to be a mere accident that all of these forces are converging at once to save us from a scenario of high birth rates and high death rates. One suspects there might be something more fundamental going on here.Are there examples of other species which do the same thing -- throttle down their birth rates as they approach the environment's carrying capacity?Maybe there's an evolutionary advantage to this. A population which generates lots of individuals destined to fight one another or die of hunger before reproducing seems to be wasting a lot of energy, especially if individuals care for their young. An overcrowded, underfed population may be more vulnerable to catastrophic disease (especially in a social species), and reduced individual fitness may actually reduce the total amount of resources the population is able to extract from the environment. If a species relies on cooperation within social groups, then perhaps excess births lead to intragroup competition that undermines group fitness. The basic principle of group fitness -- that sometimes it is more advantageous to help others in one's social group than to act directly for one's own benefit -- may be magnified when populations are stable with little room for growth (just as in a mature marketplace, it may be easiest to cooperate with an established business, whereas in a new sector it may make more sense to grow a new business from the ground up).So I would look for this phenomenon among species that form cooperative social groups and care for their young -- colony-forming insects and large social mammals spring to mind. From my amateur reading, it sounds like lions might be a non-example, regulating their population by pushing excess or unfit individuals out of the pride to their likely death (or at least, this suggests that the population is not regulated solely via birth rates). But it seems like this could be addressed experimentally: for example, if individuals from a stable population of species $X$ are introduced into a new environment that can easily support a larger population of $X$, then does their birth rate go up?If the answer to (2) is &quot;yes&quot;, then what biological mechanisms are behind this?Such a mechanism must be interpreted in the context of individuals' reproductive behavior more generally. There will be (a) factors affecting the advantageousness of reproducing, with (b) environmental cues indicative of these factors, (c) factors influencing individuals' actual reproductive behavior, and (d) biological mechanisms by which (b) influences (c).Among the (a)-type factors we're particularly interested in might be abundance of food, space, disease, social stability,... Candidates for (b) might include crowdedness, air quality, presence of greenery and wildlife, stress levels,... For (c), one might look at libido, fertility, desire for a mate or for children,... For (d), ideally one could get down to the level of things like hormone regulation.Can we use the answer to (3) to inform an answer to (1)?Here are a few crazy theories that might be supported.In urban areas, the smell of other humans and lack of greenery are cues that the population is overcrowded and food is scarce, which via some dedicated hormone-regulation system common to all mammals suppresses the desire to mate or raise offspring (but in the United States, these factors are mitigated slightly by our constant showering and our sparser settlement patterns, leading to a birthrate higher than in much of the developed world.)The gradual process of political integration and tolerance has led us to identify larger and larger subpopulations of humans as &quot;us&quot;, and a sense of being part of a large group with a stable population both upregulates pro-social behavior and somewhat suppresses the desire to have children of one's own.The elevated stress levels of modern life are a cue that one can ill-afford the investment required to reproduce, suppressing the desire for children.", "query_id": 1217}
{"query": "Why can&#39;t quantum computation replace classical computation?I am not a total novice of quantum computation (have read the first 6 chapters of Nielsen and Chuang, though not familiar with every part), but there are some fundamental questions that I don't know answers well.One question that has bothered me is that I often hear comments which say that quantum computers can not be regarded as a replacement for classical ones.However, we also know that all classical circuits can be simulated by quantum circuits.  Put it another way, every Boolean function $f:\\{0,1\\}^k\\to\\{0,1\\}$ can be computed by using a quantum circuit.So, how to correctly understand the problems that a quantum computer might encounter when doing a classical computer's job? I know a strong restriction on quantum computing is that we can't read the resulting qubits state directly, but has to use quantum measurement so that we can only get one of the computational basis states probabilistically. However, I don't see this is a difficulty if what we want to do is only to compute a Boolean function.Following are some possible answers I've thought of:Quantum computers can do everything classical computers do, but no more efficiently if we only use the standard technique to simulate classical circuits. Quantum computers outperform classical ones only when special quantum algorithms exploiting superpositions of quantum states are applied, such as the quantum Fourier transform (QFT).In Nielsen and Chuang (Section 5.1), it says QFT cannot replace classical discrete Fourier transform. Besides the problem that the amplitudes cannot be directly accessed by measurement, it points out that the worse problem is that &quot;there is in general no way to efficiently prepare the original state to be Fourier transformed.&quot; Maybe such kind of problems is important for many applications.Are the above answers right? Are there other important reasons quantum computers cannot replace the classical ones?", "query_id": 1218}

Studies of Barkhausen noise have been used in practice as a nondemolition tool to characterize the distribution of elastic stresses and the microstructure of magnetic samples&quot;.It would seem that Barkhausen noise can affect even very small magnetic particles subjected to an external magnetizing field, as might be encountered during measurement, but nowhere (it would seem) is there research on it's effect on quantum noise of the system.It appears to be a difficult or unanswered question.An answer was offered stating:The Barkhausen effect has to do with domain wall motion. The magnetic qubit discussed in the first reference is based on nm sized magnetic particle, which we can assume to be single domain, and therefore would not exhibit Barkhausen noise. This paper by Kittel [Theory of the Structure of Ferromagnetic Domains - 1946] discusses domains in magnetic particles.There are different limits stated as to what constitutes a single-domain magnetic particle, I've found upper limits ranging from 30-100 nm, with lower limits somewhat more consistent around 10 nm.While it's not precisely stated what the exact size of the particles are in that paper, and we might assume others using similar methods could utilize particles of a different size, let's assume for the sake of that one answer only that the particles in question are single domain.There are five main mechanisms due to which magnetic Barkhausen emissions occur [Jiles (1988)]:Discontinuous, irreversible domain wall motionDiscontinuous rotation of magnetic moments within a domainAppearance and disappearance of domain walls (Bloch or Neel). Domainwalls are narrow transition regions between magnetic domains. Theyonly differ in the plane of rotation of magnetization. For Blochwalls the magnetization rotates through the plane of the domain wallwhereas for Neel walls the magnetization rotates within the plane ofthe domain wall.Inversion of magnetization in single-domain particlesDisplacement of Bloch or Neel lines in two 180$°$ walls withoppositely directed magnetizationsThere are a number of papers on the measurement of Barkhausen noise in single-domain magnetic particles:&quot;Detection of the magnetization reversal of individual interacting single-domain particles within Co-Cr columnar thin-films&quot; - 1988&quot;The fundamental Barkhausen noise generated by the magnetization reversal of individual particles within a particulate magnetic medium has been observed using the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) as a sensitive magnetization probe. This is the first time the reversal of individual interacting single or nearly single domain particles has been detected. The jumps correspond to magnetic switching volumes of ~3×10$^{-15}$ cm$^3$ with moments around 10$^{-12}$ emu.&quot;.&quot;The dependence of magnetic domain structure upon magnetization state with emphasis upon nucleation as a mechanism for pseudo‐single‐domain behavior&quot; - 1983&quot;These observations thereby demonstrate that nucleation becomes increasingly more dominant as the particles become smaller, a manifestation of the random distribution of active nucleation sites. Nucleation may therefore account for much of the magnitude and grain size dependence of hysteresis parameters in the PSD range as well as resulting in a gradual transition between multidomain and PSD behavior. Fine particles completely controlled by nucleation during hysteresis behave in a strikingly parallel manner to classical single domains and are therefore quite appropriately described as being pseudo‐single‐domain.&quot;.&quot;Statistical Physics of Pure Barkhausen Noise&quot; - 2014That paper goes as far as to state:&quot;We will show that here Barkhausen Noise has nothing to do with the movement of domain walls nor with Self Organized Criticality nor with fractal domains nor with thermodynamic criteria.&quot;", "query_id": 1236}

For example Quantum Magazine:DNA Has Four Bases. Some Viruses Swap in a Fifth.A few decades ago, researchers found viruses that had swapped one of the four bases in their DNA for a novel fifth one. Now, in a trio of papers published in Science in April, three teams have identified dozens of other viruses that make this substitution, as well as the mechanisms that make it possible. The discoveries raise the thought-provoking possibility that this kind of fundamental genomic change could be much more widespread and important in biology than anyone imagined.I am interested in (and my question is) how this was established experimentally, and how widespread it is in nature, but find the original papers too technical for the non-specialist.

There are many proofs for why $s_{n - 1}^2$ is an unbiased estimator for the population variance $\\sigma^2$, although I find most clever but not particularly illuminating.Often times, as a way to provide intuition a mention will be made as to the fact that the elements of the sample will all be closer to the sample mean (as they went into its calculation). Sometimes, this intuition will be linked to the idea of degrees of freedom, which states that if we fix $\\bar{x}$, we need only determine $(n - 1)$ of the elements in the sample in order to know the $n$th element of the sample. This argument based on degrees of freedom is then used to intuition for why the unbiased estimator should involve division by $(n - 1)$ and not $n$.However, I cannot see why degrees of freedom actually matters in terms of finding an unbiased estimator.So, finally, my question is: is there a rigorous way to tie in the notion of degrees of freedom into a proof of the fact that $s_{n - 1}^2$ is an unbiased estimator of $\\sigma^2$.Note: a very similar question was posed here.  However, the answer again just gave a proof that the formula as stated is an unbiased estimator, and Bessel's correction &quot;just fell out of&quot; the manipulations. My question is - why a priori, without doing any calculations, could we have KNOWN that we should be dividing by degrees of freedom instead of by number of samples in order to get an unbiased estimate.

The gist of the argument is that environmentalist proponents of the use of wind power as a way of generating electricity and avoiding carbon dioxide emissions have been far too optimistic in their forecasts of the potential of wind power. As the source article for the Register story says in its summary (my emphasis):  Estimates of the global wind power resource over land range from 56 to 400 TW. Most estimates have implicitly assumed that extraction of wind energy does not alter large-scale winds enough to significantly limit wind power production. Estimates that ignore the effect of wind turbine drag on local winds have assumed that wind power production of 2–4 W m−2 can be sustained over large areas. New results from a mesoscale model suggest that wind power production is limited to about 1 W m−2 at wind farm scales larger than about 100 km2. We find that the mesoscale model results are quantitatively consistent with results from global models that simulated the climate response to much larger wind power capacities. Wind resource estimates that ignore the effect of wind turbines in slowing large-scale winds may therefore substantially overestimate the wind power resource.Is this argument plausible?

{"query": "Refutation of Darwin&#39;s Random Evolution TheoryI saw this refutation online of Darwin's Random Evolution Theory and cannot see any holes with the logic. Can anyone crack this simple refutation?  Refutation of the Theory of Random Evolution    As for the theory of evolution, which says that living things evolved progressively from  mud - first organism - bacteria - fish - animals - humans through tiny  random mutations which were advantageous and naturally selected;  there's a lot to say on this. All currently living life forms appears  to be highly related, sharing the same DNA system and cell structure.  This would suggest a common first ancestor as the theory suggests (or  better yet - one Designer), however, the most obvious flaw with the  theory is that the first organism must have had highly sophisticated  intelligent design. There is a minimum requirement for even the most  primitive possible life form, without which it could not possibly  survive.    Minimum Requirements for First Organism      The first organism must have a system of producing sourcing energy along with subsystems of distribution and management  of that energy which interact and work together, otherwise it cannot  power critical tasks such as reproduction.  It must have a system of reproduction which necessitates pre-existing subsystems of information storage (DNA), information  copying, and information which interact with each  other and work together. This reproductive system is dependent on a  power source, so it must be coordinated with the power system. The  reproductive system must also all critical infrastructure  such as the power system and the reproduction system along with the  \"circuitry\" and feedback mechanisms between them, otherwise the child  organism will be dead..  It must have a growth system, otherwise the organism will reduce itself every time it reproduces and vanish after a few generations.  This growth system necessitates subsystems of ingestion of materials  from the outside world, processing of those materials, distribution,  and absorption of those materials to the proper place, building the  right thing at the right place and in the right amount. It must also  have an expulsion system for waste materials.    The growth system must also be coordinated with the reproduction system. Otherwise, if the reproduction trigger happens faster than the  growth, it will reduce size faster than it grows in size and vanish  after a few generations. The growth system also requires connection to  the power infrastructure to perform its tasks.  All the \"circuitry\", signaling, and feedback infrastructure which allows the different systems and subsystems to coordinate  together and work together must be in place before the organism can  \"come alive\". The reproduction system won't work without coordination  with the growth and power systems. Likewise, the power system by  itself is useless without the growth and reproduction systems and  cannot survive. Only when all the \"circuitry\", etc. is in place and  the power is turned on is there hope for the hundreds of  interdependent tasks to start working together. Otherwise, it is like  turning on a computer which has no interconnections between the power  supply, CPU, memory, hard drive, video, operating system, etc -  nothing to write home about.  We assume it originated in water since gas is too unstable and solid is too static. If so, the organism must be contained by some  kind of membrane otherwise its precious contents will drift away in  the water due to natural diffusion or drifting of water due to  temperature variations in the water from sunlight, etc. or from heat  generated through its own power, or wind, moon, etc. If so, this makes  the assembly of such an organism more problematic, since it would need  to be closed shut before it can build itself in a stable way. Yet, to  build itself it would need to be open for a long time until all  systems are built and interconnected.      From the above minimum requirements it is clear that the simplest  possible surviving organism is by no means simple. You would need  thousands of different etc., in the right proportions,  all intricately folded and actively interacting with each other and  with sophisticated organelles.

They contain genes that are ... very important in terms of predicting drug response.&quot;Eichler also said that some of the recently uncovered genes are even responsible for making human brains larger than those of other primates, providing insight into what makes humans unique.This remaining 8% of the human genome had stumped scientists for years because of its complexities. For one thing, it contained DNA regions with several repetitions, which made it challenging to string the DNA together in the correct order using previous sequencing methods.The researchers relied on two DNA sequencing technologies that emerged over the past decade to bring this project to fruition: the Oxford Nanopore DNA sequencing method, which can sequence up to 1 million DNA letters at once but with some mistakes, and the PacBio HiFi DNA sequencing method, which can read 20,000 letters with 99.9% accuracy.CNN's explanation is helpful as far as it goes, but with Nanopore's error rate of 1% to 3% (1, 2) and the difference between the repeats of some repeated sequences presumably a lot less than that, how was the error-prone Nanopore method combined with the HiFi method to nail the last 8% of the human genome accurately despite the repeated sequence challenges?Question: What were the challenges to sequencing the last 8% of the human genome that took 20 years to overcome and how was this done?

{"query": "Why is $R_t$ (or $R_0$) and not doubling rate or time the go-to metric for measuring Covid-19 expansion?In my head, the natural way to measure the expansion speed of an epidemic across populations of different sizes is simply fitting an exponential over recent infection numbers (with any strategy), getting a parameter $C$ for $I(t) \\approx e^{Ct}$. This gives useful practical information such as the doubling time.From what I understand, the effective reproduction number $R_t$ is a quantity that is related but not equal to $C$. In fact, in some simple models $C$ is a function of $R_t$ and of the mean infectious period $\\tau$. (which makes sense, as $R_t$ is a dimensionless unit and would be the same for two different epidemics that are obtained one from the other only by rescaling time).The mean infectious time $\\tau$ is a quantity that cannot be estimated directly from the data, and must be provided as an external parameter. This parameter is not trivial to estimate in itself; for instance the abstract of this paper gives an estimate of $6.5 - 9.5$ days for Covid-19.The true relationship between $R_t$ and $C$ is probably even more complicated because it also depends on how these infections are distributed across the infectious period.Intuitively, the difficulty in estimating $\\tau$ should reflect in $R_t$ having a larger error bar than $C$. Indeed, I have seen in the media some estimates of $R_t$ with ridiculously large confidence intervals; for instance this one for an Italian region with 4M inhabitants was published by an Italian newspaper on their website.So, here is my question: wouldn't it be simpler, and more useful, to use $C$ (or, equivalently, the doubling time) as a measure of the expansion speed of an epidemics? This quantity would probably be more reliable to estimate, since it does not depend on extraneous parameters such as $\\tau$.$R_t$ has the property that an epidemic is spreading if it is larger than $1$, and contracting if it is smaller than $1$; $C$ has the same property with $0$ being the discriminating value. So from the point of view of giving an easy reference value both are equally effective.So why do many governments and state agencies routinely report $R_t$ rather than the rate $C$ as their main measure, and use it to determine when measures have to be enforced? What makes it more useful than the doubling time?", "query_id": 1296}

Entropy, is the amount of energy not available for useful work. It can also be measured as an amount of disorder. So, in a closed system, as the disorder increases, it needs external energies to be applied to it in order for the entropy to decrease, apparently.Dr John Ross of Harvard University states:    … there are no known violations of the second law of thermodynamics. Ordinarily the second law is stated for isolated systems, but the second law applies equally well to open systems. …  There is somehow associated with the field of far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics the notion that the second law of thermodynamics fails for such systems. It is important to make sure that this error does not perpetuate itself.The source is: Chemical and Engineering News, 7 July 1980, p. 40;Since the universe is a closed system, entropy will continually increase,and consequently, the disorder in our universe will be on an uphill run.

{"query": "From mathematical notation to quantum circuit, in generalI am learning the basics of quantum computing using Qiskit and I encountered a problem when I tried to solve some of our course exercises. I feel like I am missing an invisible step, the step from mathematical notation to the quantum circuit.I am familiar with the Dirac notation and the matrices of the quantum gates, and how they transform the inputs. I can understand for instance how to achieve the effect of a Toffoli gate while only using two-qubit gates. However the problem arises when I try to encode a mathematical transformation into quantum gates. Let's start simple:When I first learned about a CNOT gate I understood the effect, and therefore the conclusion that it was the quantum version of XOR did not surprise me that much. It just seemed a handy side-effect. Hence I can encode$$|y⟩_1|x⟩_0→|x⊕y⟩_1|x⟩_0$$by a CNOT gate.qc = QuantumCircuit(q)qc.cx(0,1)Then I got an exercise to build a half adder:$$|z⟩_2|y⟩_1|x⟩_0→|z⊕xy⟩_2|x⊕y⟩_1|x⟩_0$$This confused me a lot because I do not now how to encode the AND part. Hence even this$$|z⟩_2|y⟩_1|x⟩_0→|xy⟩_2|y⟩_1|x⟩_0$$I would not know. Luckily the book walks over the 'adding' part of the half-adder, which is when I learned that a Toffoli gate would do the job.qc = QuantumCircuit(3)qc.ccx(0, 1, 2)qc.cx(0, 1)I hope you can see the step I am missing: I know 'tricks' for some solutions, but I don't know how to encode a general mathematical transformation. Hence I was baffled when I was asked about unitary function encoding, and to encode the following,$$U:|y⟩|x⟩↦|f(x)+y \\mod 2^m⟩|x⟩$$where $f$ is an arbitrary boolean function $f:\\{0,1\\}^n↦\\{0,1\\}^m$. I had NO clue how to approach this.Therefore my question is the following. How do I encode an arbitrary mathematical expression like I have given above to a quantum circuit? Most importantly: What are the general steps you take when you approach a problem like this?

If so, what are those rules and can anyone recommend any resources where I can learn more about this subject?  Thanks.MORE DETAILSLet me try and explain what I am trying to ask.  I understand that there are rules of grammar that I need to follow in order to put together a well formed English sentence.  I am wondering if there is something akin to that for stringing together amino acids in order to create a 'well-formed' protein. (I am NOT referring to how DNA codes for amino acids).For instance, imagine that I wanted to create a new protein and I had a pile of amino acids at my disposal.  It seems to me that if I understood the principles and rules by which amino acid chains work then I could know which amino acids to string together and the order in which to string them together in order to create the particular type of protein that I wish to create.  This is similar to how I can string together letters and words to form well formed sentences or how I can string together well-formed sentences to create logical arguments.  There's a logic to how to form a sentence and a different logic for how to form an argument -- and it is possible to discern that logic by studying syntax and reasonable arguments.  I assume the same is true for proteins.  There must be some sort of logic or system for how amino acids are strung together -- some sort of connection between the 3-dimension, functional protein and the nature of the properties of the individual amino acids and how they are organized together.

It seems to me that it should be legitimate in any case since microRNAs are approximately the same length, but maybe I am overlooking something.  For example, I am following a paper published in Nature Communications entitled \"Identification of a pan-cancer oncogenic microRNA superfamily anchored by a central core seed motif\".  The authors download the data and collapse isoform reads to a single read count using the reads.  They say they used the reads per million microRNAs mapped, which establishes each microRNA read count as a fraction of the total microRNA population.  The authors then do upper quartile normalization which they say is important because a subset of microRNAs (miR-143 in particular) contributes so significantly to the total read count.  In the text, the authors appear to use the resulting values to do a direct comparison between microRNAs. I definitely want the collapsed isoforms, and I think it makes sense to do the normalization.

Since HHL assumes that $A$ is Hermitian, $\\lambda_i$ are real.

This can theoretically continue until glycogen is depleted or severely diminished as far as I understand. The problem comes then from the H+ ions produced during the glycolysis. These ions cause acidosis of the muscles if not removed. However, they can be removed if sufficient oxygen is present to form water. And here is my main question :Why, during high intensity exercise, would oxygen be insufficient to take care of the H+ ions produced by the glycolysis ? Is it because muscles used during high intensity are not the best ones for oxygen? Is it also because these H+ ions cannot be transported towards neighbouring muscles able to oxidise H+ ions ? I understand this is a difficult question and maybe there is no precise answer at the moment. If you could point me toward a good ressource that deals with this question, I would be glad.

The doctor represented a sham vaccination program (against Hepatitis B), asking for permission to vaccinate the children in the compound, with the intention of running DNA analyses on the syringes afterwards to determine whether any of the children were bin Laden's. The effort failed because the doctor didn't get a chance to vaccinate any of the children.On a recent episode of Star Talk Radio, Lori Garrett (sp?) asserted that this caused a violent backlash against healthcare workers, including numerous assassinations of volunteer helpers to the Polio eradication campaign. An article in Scientific American seems to corroborate this. (The doctor himself appears to have been sentenced to 33 years in a Pakistani prison for his actions.)Moral issues with using healthcare workers for non-healthcare purposes aside, is that really true? Did the Taliban (or other Muslim groups) start or increase their anti-vaccination actions after this became public?

Instead, IPCC replaced the damning (but accurate) diagram with a new diagram in which the inconsistency has been disappeared.There are a number of technical issues here (even in the first chart: eg what does the grey bad mean and what is its derivation?). But the thrust of his argument seems to be that the IPCC have deliberately chosen a way of presenting the data that obscures what seems like an obvious problem: model skill doesn't seem to be very good in the last decade or so.I think answers to the questions of whether there is a problem with model skill would be better addressed in this question: Are the IPCC climate change models overestimating sensitivity to carbon dioxide? so please don't make them in answers here. My question is simpler: is Mcintyre correct to argue that the IPCC have modified their presentation of the data in a way that obscures the discrepancy?

These plants are not adapted to the high light intensity so would find it hard to survive and compete, through inter-species competition, with newly arrived plant species that are much more adapted to the extra light intensity. Obviously this would cause a dramatic reduction in the numbers of the previous plant species and would result in migration of the animals due to lack of food, assuming they can't feed on the newly arrived plants, and a change in the food chain. In what ways do this affect the local and regional ecosystem, and what problems could it produce (both from an ecosystem and human perspective)? These types of land-use changes are often seen as problematic in conservation biology (as \"...a bad thing\").

Is the increase in financial damages recorded over the last century simply down to the fact there are now more people living in the paths of hurricanes, who are generally wealthier?    Previous research has concluded that the rise in damages was related to wealth, and not to any statistically significant change in frequency.    However this new paper challenges that view.    ...    By working out similar figures for events across the last century, the researchers were able to make what they say are more realistic comparisons    ...    The authors found that the frequency of the most damaging hurricanes had increased by a rate of 330% per century.    And they believe that is mainly due to rising temperatures.The report implies that the previous science has failed to validate the idea that hurricanes are getting worse because of climate change but that this new work, unambiguously, clarifies that there is a relationship caused by a changing climate. Not everyone agrees. Roger Pielke (sometimes accused of being a climate skeptic but also a published expert on extreme weather) disagrees and argues the new results are flawed:  The bottom line here is that a fatally flawed paper on climate science passed peer review at a significant journal. It used a dataset found online that had not undergone peer review, much less any quality control.The original paper is published in PNAS here. The associated press release claims:  Hurricanes are becoming bigger, stronger and more dangerous -- an improved calculation method now shows a clear tendency(I mention this explicit claim to avoid any answers claiming that the problem is how the media interpret a technical paper: the key claim in in the press release and the paper. The issue isn't what the media said, but what the paper claims).So who is right: the new paper or Pielke?

Preferences for protection benefited ancestral women by increasing the  survival chances of their offspring.

Conversely, growth in man-made emissions surged ~25% from 2003-2011, but the change in the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 has flatlined since 1999 along with global temperatures.

The brain in our intestines contains about as many brain cells as a cat's brain and lies like a thin layer along the entire length of the intestine. It consists of exactly the same brain cells as our other brain and produces the same neurotransmitters. It communicates with our brain via the nervus vagus, the nerve that connects the brain to the intestines and one of the most important nerves we have. It is also super fast, because our intestines and brains need to be able to communicate very quickly with each other. The bacteria in our intestines can hack that system and change the signals. That way they can give our main brain instructions.[...]A psychiatrist told me that people with depression often suffer from severe constipation. This has been known for a long time, but no one has ever come up with the idea to remedy the constipation and see if the depression then improved. And that turns out to be the case. This is not because people feel better because they are no longer constipated, but because the constipation has a direct effect on the brain.

If I make a large change for the piston, I imagine there will be an abrupt relaxation to equilibrium and this will be related to large dissipation. But If I make many quasi-static changes, then at each change the dissipation should be small, such that at the end more energy is extracted.

For contextThat is the feature which is, of course, not known in geometricaloptics, and which is involved in the idea of wavelength; thewavelength tells us approximately how far away the light must “smell”the path in order to check it. It is hard to demonstrate this fact ona large scale with light, because the wavelengths are so terriblyshort. But with radiowaves, say 33-cm waves, the distances over whichthe radiowaves are checking are larger. If we have a source ofradiowaves, a detector, and a slit, as in Fig. 26–13, the rays ofcourse go from S to D because it is a straight line, and if we closedown the slit it is all right—they still go. But now if we move thedetector aside to D′, the waves will not go through the wide slit fromS to D′, because they check several paths nearby, and say, “No, myfriend, those all correspond to different times.” On the other hand,if we prevent the radiation from checking the paths by closing theslit down to a very narrow crack, then there is but one pathavailable, and the radiation takes it! With a narrow slit, moreradiation reaches D′ than reaches it with a wide slit!To my understanding, he is saying that the ray &quot;probes&quot; the path ahead (the extent of this probing depends on its wavelength) to determine which path it takes. This probing can be blocked by a narrow slit. If the probing is blocked, then the ray becomes &quot;undetermined&quot; and &quot;may&quot; bend for another path.

The hypothesis is that cases have worse school grades than controls (this is of course already known, but I will also look at other covariates here).I am not starting by looking at grades, and then trying to determine whether or not the children with low grades were exposed (=had a brain tumor or not) - which would make it a case-control study. No, instead, I look at whether or not a child is a case (=brain tumor) or a control (=no brain tumor), and then find out what grades they have - this makes it a retrospective cohort study.So I do exposure first, then look at outcome = retrospective cohort study.Not outcome first, then look at exposure = not a case-control study.This took me quite some time to realize, and also my statisticians got this wrong, because if you have cases and controls, people (including myself) easily think it is a case-control study.So, my questions here are:Do you agree with me that this is a retrospective cohort study, and not a case-control study (even though it uses the terms &quot;case&quot; and &quot;control&quot;)?Since the controls are matched against the cases (on at least some variables that are known to influence school grades, i.e. sex and residency), I have been told to use conditional logistic regression (clogit) when investigating the relationship between being a case and failing a school subject Any thoughts on this, as opposed to using ordinary logistic regression models?When I read more on this, it is usually assumed that clogit is used mainly in case-control studies. Is it not valid in retrospective cohort studies?Specifically, this quote from the following article gets me thinking:&quot;Matching in case–control studies can also have other counterintuitive effects because the matching is across outcome groups rather than exposure groups, and thus does not necessarily result in balancing the matching factors across exposure groups. &quot;I would argue that the matching in my study is not &quot;across outcome groups&quot; - the controls are not selected based on school grades - but rather &quot;across exposure groups&quot; - the controls ARE selected based on that they DO NOT have brain tumors, and also based on sex,  birth year, and residency.I have asked different statisticians to clarify the above for me, and get mumbling or unclear answers only, or otherwise answers that later turn out to be incorrect.

Does this say, higher the detuning, lower the projection into the $|r_i〉$ state since this term comes with a negative sign? And what about the last term?Also in the context of programmable quantum simulations there is a term that is very significant in experiments and is used very commonly in papers in this subject, which refers to the $\\frac{\\Delta}{\\Omega}$ ratio.

Even better, is there a guarantee that as $n \\to \\infty$, our envelope approaches $f$?In general, I am opening this post to see if there are probability theory that present the material from this perspective or if there are other fields in mathematics that define similar constructs.EDIT : Actually, the &quot;envelope&quot; is not majoring the density function but the cumulative function. But the core of the argumentation stays the same.", "query_id": 1490}

{"query": "On the definition of tilting of a perfectoid fieldGiven a perfectoid field $K$, for example $\\widehat{\\mathbf{Q}_p(\\zeta_{p^{\\infty}})}, or $\\widehat{\\mathbf{Q}_p(\\zeta_{p^{\\infty}},  According to Bhatt's lecture note ( If I understand correct, see for example section 3.2), seems we have to first define the tilting of the ring of integer $K^{\\circ\\flat}$, then define $K^{\\flat}$ to be the fraction field of the former, or more precisely invert certain element $t$ (see for example Prop 3.2.4). While on the other hand, notice there is a more &quot;direct?&quot; way to define the &quot;tilting&quot; directly as$\\varprojlim_{\\phi}K$ (If I am correct, this is exactly the $R(E)$ defined in  the original paper of Wintenberger :see section 4.1)Remark: Sure, you can not see directly what is the addition: in priori $\\varprojlim_{\\phi}K$ is only a multiplicative monoid, while the fact that there is a bijection \\varprojlim_{\\phi} O_K$ help us to &quot;transfer&quot; the addition structure from the former to the latter (via this bijection). But as in the original paper of Wintenberger section 4.1, you can just formally define that addition: $(x_n)+(y_n):=(z_n)$ with $z_n:=\\lim_m(x_{n+m}+y_{n+m})^{p^m}$, to make it a characteristic $p$ field.Question: Do these two definitions coincide? Moreprecisely, do we have $Frac(\\varprojlim_{\\phi}O_K) \\simeq \\varprojlim_{\\phi}K$?Remark: There is an injective map (from left to right): it suffices to map $\\frac{1}{y}$ for any $y=(y_n)_{n\\in\\mathbf{N}}\\in (O_K)^{\\flat}$, to $(\\frac{1}{y_n})_{n\\in \\mathbf{N}}\\in \\varprojlim_{\\phi}K$. While for the surjectivity  it is a little subtle: take any $z=(z_n)_n\\in \\varprojlim_{\\phi}K$, we can write $z_0=\\frac{x_0}{y_0}$, and in our case we can construct $x=(x_n)_n$ and $y=(y_n)_n\\in (O_K)^{\\flat}$ and expect is a preimage. But then you notice, first position is by construction $\\frac{x_0}{y_0}=z_0$, good, but the second position is $\\frac{x_1}{y_1}$ which is indeed a $p$-th root of $z_0$, but not necessarily the $z_1$ (Notice if we were working in characteristic $p$, then they must coincide $z_1=\\frac{x_1}{y_1}$ as &quot;$x^p=y^p \\Longleftrightarrow x=y$ in char $p$&quot;).
